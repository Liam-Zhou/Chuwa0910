5. Eager loading:
public class EagerLoadedSingleton {//always create exactly one instance

    private static final EagerLoadedSingleton instance = new EagerLoadedSingleton();

    private EagerLoadedSingleton() {}

    public static EagerLoadedSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}

Lazy Loading: 
public class LazyLoadedSingleton {//create exactly one instance until we need it

    private static LazyLoadedSingleton instance;

    private LazyLoadedSingleton() {}

    public static synchronized LazyLoadedSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new LazyLoadedSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

6. Runtime execeptions are errors that the compiler couldn't detect during compile time. The best example would be array index out of bound exception.

7. Nullpointer exception example: 
new List<Integer> a = null;
a.add(0);

8. Optional class: a container that contains a null or non-null object.

9. By using optional class, in the case of some code might produce null exceptions, we can just use optional to substitue the expected null value.

10. @functionalInterface annotation marks an interface with only one abstract method, and multiple default method. You can override the methods in functional Interface in it's extended class.

11. Lambda expression is something we use to implement the functional interface without creating a class. It's also called anonymous functions, because it eliminates the functions name, signature, and return type, and only keeps what it does.
