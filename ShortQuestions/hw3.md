## 1. Practice collection

## 2. What is the checked exception and unchecked exception in Java, could you give one example?

- Checked Exception: exceptions that are checked at compile time. E.g. IOException
- Unchecked Exception: exceptions that are checked at runtime. E.g. NullPointerException

## 3. Can there be multiple finally blocks?

No. can be multiple catch blocks but only one finally block.

## 4. When both catch and finally return values, what will be the final result?

return the finally value

## 5. What is Runtime/unchecked exception? what is Compile/Checked Exception?

- Checked(Compile) Exception: exceptions that are checked at compile time. E.g. IOException
- Unchecked(Runtime) Exception: exceptions that are checked at runtime. E.g. NullPointerException

## 6. What is the difference between throw and throws?

```
// throw
throw new IOException();

// throws
public void getOrder(String id) throws Exception {}
```

## 7. Run the below three pieces codes, Noticed the printed exceptions. why do we put the Null/Runtime exception before Exception?

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 3;
        String s = null;
        try {
            System.out.println(b / a);
            System.out.println(s.equals("aa"));
            throw new RuntimeException();
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.getMessage();
}
        System.out.println("End ...");
    }
}
```

Throw ArithmeticException

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 3;
        String s = null;
        try {
            // System.out.println(b / a);
            System.out.println(s.equals("aa"));
            throw new RuntimeException();
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.getMessage();
        }
        System.out.println("End ...");
    }
}
```

Throw NullPointerException

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 3;
        String s = null;
        try {
            // System.out.println(b / a);
            // System.out.println(s.equals("aa"));
            throw new RuntimeException();
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.getMessage();
}
        System.out.println("End ...");
    }
}
```

Throw RuntimeException

why do we put the Null/Runtime exception before Exception? Because 'catch' scope should be from shall to large

## 8. What is optional? why do you use it? write an optional example.

Optional is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. In other words, an Optional object can either contain a non-null(present) value or no value at all (empty).

## 9. Why finally always be executed ?

Some Aftercare operations need to be done even exception happens. E.g. Open a file, get an exception, but never close. It is wrong so we need 'finally'.

## 11. What is Java 8 new features ?

## 12. What are the types of design patterns in Java ?

## 13. What are the SOLID Principles ?

## 14. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java ?

## 15. What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) ? 16. Liskovâ€™s substitution principle states that if class B is a subtype of class A, then object of type A may be substituted with any object of type B. What does this actually mean? (from OA ) choose your answer.

## 17. It mean that if the object of type A can do something, the object of type B could also be able to perform the same thing

## 18. It means that all the objects of type A could execute all the methods present in its subtype B

## 19. It means if a method is present in class A, it should also be present in class B so that the object of type B could substitute object of type A.

## 20. It means that for the class B to inherit class A, objects of type B and objects of type A must be same.
