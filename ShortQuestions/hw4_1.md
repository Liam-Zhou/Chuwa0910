## Homework 4.1

1. **List all of the new annotations to your annotaitons.md and explain its role.**
    - Already updated in hw4_0.md
<br/>

2. **how do you do the debug in Spring?**
    - Step1: Add logging info in the application
    - Step2: Read the corresponding log file and troubleshoot the rough problem location
    - Step 3: Add breakpoint in the code and debug it to help locate the problem
    - Step 4: Fix the problem and use unit-test to ensure it's working properly
<br/>

3. **What is DTO, VO, Payload, DO, model?**
    - DTO: Data Transfer Object, used to transfer data between layers, usually in service between entity and controller
    - VO: View Object, similar to DTO
    - Payload: The data that is sent to the server in a POST request
    - DO: Domain Object, the object that is persisted in the database
    - Model: The object that is used to transfer data between layers, usually in controller between service and view
<br/>

4. **What is @JsonProperty("description_yyds")?**
    - It's a rule to map the java object to json object or vice versa, the property name in json object is "description_yyds"
<br/>

5. **Do you know what is jackson?**
    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
        <version>2.13.3</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```
    - It's a library that can convert java object to json object or vice versa, contained in the spring-boot-starter-web dependency
<br/>

6. **What is spring-boot-stater?**
    - It's a dependency containing all the dependencies needed for a specific function, for example, spring-boot-starter-web contains all the dependencies that are needed for a web application.

    - **what dependecies in the below starter? do you know any starters?**
    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```
    - A starter for building web applications, including RESTful applications, using Spring MVC.
    - Other starters:
        - spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
        - spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb
        - spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
<br/>

7. **Do you know `@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = 
RequestMethod.POST)` ? could you list CRUD by this style?**
    - It's a annotation that maps the request to the corresponding method, the value is the path of the request, the method is the type of the request
    - It's equivalent to: `@PostMapping("/users")`
    - CRUD:
        - Create: `@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)`
        - Read: `@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)`
        - Update: `@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.PUT)`
        - Delete: `@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)`
<br/>

8. **What is ResponseEntity? why do we need it?**
    ```
    new ResponseEntity<>(postResponse, HttpStatus.OK);
    new ResponseEntity<>(postResponse, HttpStatus.CREATED);
    ```
    - It's a class that wraps the response, it's used to return the response with the corresponding status code
<br/>

9. **What is ResultSet in jdbc? and describe the flow how to get data using JDBC**
    - It's a table of data representing a database result set, which is usually generated by executing a statement that queries the database.
    ```
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
    ```
<br/>

10. **What is the ORM framework?**
    - ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages and relational databases.
    - It allows us to use object-oriented programming languages to manipulate relational databases.
<br/>

11. **Learn how to use ObjectMapper by this example.**
    ```
    FoodOutlet foodOutlet = 
    objectMapper.readValue(resBody, FoodOutlet.class);
    String s = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(foodOutlet);
    objectMapper.readTree() // learn how to use it?
    ```
    - It's a class that can convert java object to json object or vice versa
    - `.readValue()`: convert json object to java object
    - `.writeValueAsString()`: convert java object to json object
    - `.readTree()`: convert json object to JsonNode object
        - `JsonNode` is a class that represents a node of the json object
        - `JsonNode.get("name")`: get the value of the property "name" in the json object
<br/>

12. **What is the serialization and desrialization?**
    - Serialization is the process of converting a data object—a combination of code and data represented within a region of data storage—into a series of bytes that saves the state of the object in an easily transmittable form. In this serialized form, the data can be delivered to another data store (such as an in-memory computing platform), application, or some other destination.
    - Deserialization is the process of reconstructing a data structure or object from a series of bytes or a string in order to instantiate the object for consumption. This is the reverse process of serialization, i.e., converting a data structure or object into a series of bytes for storage or transmission across devices. To fetch an object state over a wire or read it from persistent storage, a system must be able to deserialize it from raw bytes.
<br/>

13. **Use stream api to get the average of the array [20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32].**

    - Use `IntStream`:
    ```
    int[] arr = {20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
    double average = Arrays.stream(arr).average().getAsDouble();
    ```
    - Use `Stream`:
    ```
    int[] arr = {20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
    double sum = Arrays.stream(arr).sum();
    double average = sum / arr.length;
    ```
<br/>
