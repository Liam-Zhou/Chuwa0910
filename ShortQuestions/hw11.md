2: What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
```text
Spring is a framework that helps you to build enterprise application, it provides a lot of tools to help you to build the application, like dependency injection, transaction management, etc. Springboot is a tool that helps you to build spring application, it will help you to configure the application, and provide a lot of default configuration, so you don't need to configure it manually.
Springboot will help you to build a spring application quickly, and it will help you to configure the application, so you don't need to configure it manually.
```

3:  What is IOC and What is DI
```text
IoC is a design principle or a software architectural concept. It essentially means that the flow of control in a system is inverted compared to traditional programming models. In traditional programming, the developer controls the flow of the program, deciding when and how to call functions or methods. In IoC, the control over the flow of a program's execution is shifted from the program itself to a framework or container. 
Dependency Injection is a specific technique used to implement IoC. It's a way of passing dependencies (e.g., objects, services, or other components) into a class rather than having the class create its dependencies. T

4: @CompnonentScan
```text
@ComponentScan is an annotation used in the Spring Framework, particularly in Spring Boot applications, to enable automatic scanning and detection of Spring-managed components, such as @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller classes within a specified package or packages. 
```

5:  How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
```text
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.demo")
```

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

    <!-- Enable component scanning and specify the base package(s) to scan -->
    <context:component-scan base-package="com.example.myapp"/>

    <!-- Other bean definitions can go here -->

</beans>
```

6: What is  @SpringbootApplication?
```text
@Configuration: It indicates that the class is a configuration class, similar to a traditional Spring XML configuration file. This means that the class can define Spring beans using @Bean methods.
@EnableAutoConfiguration: This annotation enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature, which automatically configures various aspects of the application based on the project's dependencies and the environment. It helps reduce the need for manual configuration.
@ComponentScan: This annotation enables component scanning, allowing Spring to automatically discover and register Spring components (such as @Controller, @Service, @Repository, and @Component classes) in the specified package and its sub-packages.
```

7: How many ways wo can define a bean?
```text
<bean id="exampleBean" class="com.example.ExampleBean">
    <property name="property" value="value" />
</bean>
```
```java
@Component
public class ExampleBean {
    // class body
}
```

8: What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean
```text
@Component: The default bean name is the uncapitalized non-qualified class name.
@Bean: The default bean name is the method name.
```
9: What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?
```text
@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component or bean.
@Repository is a stereotype for the persistence layer.
@Service is a stereotype for the service layer.
@Controller is a stereotype for the presentation layer (spring-MVC).
```

10:  How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean
```text
@Autowired  @Resource  @Value
```

11: Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans
in Spring)? Which way is better and why
```text
Constructor Injection
Setter Injection
Field Injection
Constructor Injection is better, because it will make the class immutable, and it will make the class easier to test
```
If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let
the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay
```text
@Primary
@Qualifier
```

13: What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
```text
BeanFactory is the root interface for accessing the Spring container. ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory and adds support for Spring-specific features such as easier integration with Spring AOP, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event publication, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext for use in web applications.
```

What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope
```text
singleton: only one instance of the bean will be created for each container. This is the default scope for the spring beans. While using this scope, make sure bean doesn't have shared instance variables otherwise it might lead to data inconsistency issues because it's not thread-safe.
prototype: A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested.
request: This is same as prototype scope, however it's meant to be used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be created for each HTTP request.
session: A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the container.
global-session: This is used to create global session beans for Portlet applications.
```

```java
@Scope("singleton")
public class SingletonScope {
    // class body...
}
```

```java
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeScope {
    // class body...
}
```

```java
@Scope("request")
public class RequestScope {
    // class body...
}
```

```java
@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST)
public class SessionScope {
    // class body...
}
```

Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we
configure the bean?
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- Define Engine Bean -->
    <bean id="engine" class="com.example.Engine">
        <property name="type" value="V8"/>
    </bean>

    <!-- Define Car Bean -->
    <bean id="car" class="com.example.Car">
        <property name="brand" value="Toyota"/>
        <property name="engine" ref="engine"/>
    </bean>

</beans>
```
