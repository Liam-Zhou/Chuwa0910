2. What is MVC pattern?

    The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a design pattern commonly used in software development for organizing code in a way that separates concerns, improving the modularity and flexibility of the application. It divides the application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.

    1. Components of MVC:
       
       1. Model:
          
          - Responsibilities: It represents the data and business logic of the application. The model is responsible for retrieving, storing, and processing the data. It communicates to the database and updates the View whenever the data changes.
          - Characteristics: The model is independent of the user interface and does not have any information about the presentation layer.
       
       2. View:
          
          - Responsibilities: It represents the UI of the application. The view displays data from the model to the user and sends user commands to the controller.
          - Characteristics: The view is responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting the data to the user. It is updated by the model.
       
       3. Controller:
          
          - Responsibilities: It handles user input and interactions, processes them (with possible updates to the Model), and returns the output display (View).
          - Characteristics: Acts as an interface between Model and View. It takes the user's requests and handles them, which may include updating the model or returning an updated view to the client.
    
    2. Workflow of MVC:
       
       - User Interaction: The user interacts with the View, which generates user actions.
       - Controller Processing: These user actions are then handled by the Controller. The controller processes the user's input, executes business operations with the Model, and returns the output display (updated View).
       - Model Updating: The Model performs the business operations and updates the View.
       - View Rendering: The View takes the data and displays it to the user. The user sees the updated view and continues to interact.
   
    3. Advantages of MVC:
     
       - Separation of Concerns: It separates the business logic, user interface, and user input, making the codebase organized, modular, and easier to manage and scale.
       - Reusability: Components can be reused, as the separation allows developers to change the user interface without touching the business logic and vice versa.
       - Testability: Easier to test individual components in isolation.
       - Flexibility: Allows multiple views to use the same model.
    
    4. Example in Web Application:
       
       - Model: Consists of database interaction, data processing, and algorithms.
       - View: HTML, CSS, JS, and templates to present the data to users.
       - Controller: Handles HTTP requests, executes business logic, and returns the appropriate view.

3. What is Front-Controller?

    The Front Controller is a design pattern used in web applications to provide a centralized entry point for handling requests. It is a controller that manages the flow of data and navigation in the entire application or a portion of it. By having a single place to handle all requests, the Front Controller helps in standardizing request handling and allows for centralized control, like authentication, authorization, logging, request tracking, etc.

    Key Points of Front-Controller Pattern:
    
    1. Centralized Request Handling:
       
       All the requests to the application are intercepted by the Front Controller first. It acts as a gate that controls and manages all client requests.

    2. Configuration:
       
       It configures and prepares resources needed by the system, ensuring that each request is ready to be processed.

    3. Command Processing:
       
       Front Controller may use a dispatcher that dispatches the requests to appropriate handlers (controllers) based on the nature of the request.
    
    4. View Selection:
       
       It selects which view should be used to render the response data and sends it to the client.
    
    5. Security:
       
       The pattern allows for centralized security measures like authentication and authorization, ensuring security protocols are followed before the request reaches the application.
    
    6. Logging and Auditing:
       
       Having a central point of entry allows easy tracking and logging of each request and response, making auditing and monitoring easy.

4. What is DispatcherServlet? Please decribe how it works.

    In the case of the Spring Framework, the DispatcherServlet acts as the Front Controller. Here is how it works:

    1. Request Reception: The DispatcherServlet receives the incoming HTTP request.

    2. Handler Mapping: It then identifies the appropriate controller to handle the request using a handler mapping.

    3. Controller Execution: The chosen controller executes the business logic and returns a model along with a view name.

    4. View Rendering: The DispatcherServlet then uses a view resolver to map the view name to the actual view (like a JSP page, Thymeleaf template, etc.), and the view is rendered and returned as a response.

    Example Code Structure:
     
    ```
    // DispatcherServlet as Front Controller
    public class DispatcherServlet extends HttpServlet {
       protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
          processRequest(request, response);
       }

       protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
          processRequest(request, response);
       }

       private void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
          // Determine the appropriate handler based on the request
          // Execute the handler to process the request
          // Select the view to render the response
          // etc.
       }
    }
    ```

5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView? 

    1. JSP (JavaServer Pages):
       
       JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a server-side technology used for creating web applications. It is used to create dynamic content on the server using HTML, XML templates, and Java code. JSP is similar to PHP, but it uses Java for the programming needs. JSP allows embedding Java directly into HTML pages.

       1. Key Features of JSP:
       
          - Simplicity: JSP is easy to use and can be learned quickly by anyone with basic programming knowledge.
          - Powerful: JSP pages use Java, making them as powerful as any Java class.
          - Platform Independence: Like Java, JSP is platform-independent and can be run on any operating system or server.
          - Separation of Concerns: JSP supports the separation of presentation and business logic.

       2. Basic Structure of a JSP Page:
          
          ```
          <%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>
          <head>
             <meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
             <title>Insert title here</title>
          </head>
          <body>
             Hello, Your IP address is <%= request.getRemoteAddr() %>
          </body>
          </html>
          ```
       
     2. ModelAndView in Spring:
        
        ModelAndView is a class in Spring MVC that is often used to make the controllers in a Spring application more flexible and to integrate the controllers with view pages (like JSP). It acts as a container for both the Model and the View and is used to pass both of them together from the controller to the view layer.

        1. Key Features of ModelAndView:
           
           - Combination of Model & View: It combines both the logical view name and the model data that the view will use to render itself.
           - Flexible: Allows the controller to pass data, along with view information, directly to the dispatcher servlet.
           - Clear Separation: Helps in clearly separating the roles of the controller and the view.

        2. Example of Using ModelAndView:
           
           ```
           import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;
           import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

           public class MyController {

              @RequestMapping("/greeting")
              public ModelAndView greeting() {
                 ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();
                 mav.addObject("message", "Hello World");
                 mav.setViewName("greeting");
                 return mav;
              }
           }
           ```
           
           In this example, a method named greeting() is defined to return a ModelAndView object. The addObject method is used to add model data to the response, and the setViewName method is used to set the logical view name. Here, the logical view name is "greeting", which will be resolved to a view page like a JSP, Thymeleaf, etc., by the view resolver.
