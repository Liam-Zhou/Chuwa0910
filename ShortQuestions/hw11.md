# hw11: exception,validation + mvc

1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md
    Done
2. what is the `@configuration` and `@bean`?  
   `@Configuration` is an annotation, used to indicate that a class is a configuration class. Configuration classes are responsible for defining Spring beans and their relationships.  
   `@Bean` is an annotation, used to define Spring beans within a configuration class.
3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?  
    I use `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations to create a global exception handler for my application. The steps are as follows:  
    - Create a custom exception class that extends `RuntimeException`, like `MyException`;
    - Create a global exception handler class that is annotated with `@ControllerAdvice`. This class will contain methods annotated with `@ExceptionHandler(MyException.class)` to handle my custom exception;
    - Using `throw new MyException()` wherever I need inside the program.
4. How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotations you know.  
    - Import dependency: `spring-boot-starter-validation`;
    - Add validation rule to payload;
    - Add `@valid` to controller to enable validation.
   Some validation annotations: `@NotNull`, `@NotBlank`, `@Min`, `@Max`, `@Size`, etc.
5. What is the actuator?  
 Actuator is an automation tool that help you monitor and manage your Spring Boot applications. It offers various built-in tools and endpoints that allow you to gather information about your application's health, metrics, environment, and more.
6. What is MVC pattern?  
    MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, is a design pattern when build user interfaces in an application. Model is a container for data; View is the front page template; Controller is the intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input, processes it, and invokes the appropriate actions in the Model.
7. What is Front-Controller?  
    Front-Controller maps the incoming request to a controller.
8. What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works.  
   serves as the Front Controller and is responsible for routing and dispatching incoming requests to the appropriate controllers, handling various aspects of request processing, and managing the overall flow of the application.  
    - Request Handling: receive http requests from webserver;
    - Handler Mapping: call HandlerMapper and receive corresponding Controller and controller method;
    - Controller Execution: send request to the selected controller, where the business logic is executed. Get result includes a model and a logical view name;
    - ViewResolver: Using the view name to get a view template;
    - View Rendering: put model data into view template and response to client.
9. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView?(please google to have basic knowledge)  
    JavaServer Pages, are HTML-like documents that can contain Java code to generate dynamic content and interact with the server.  
    ModelAndView represents the combination of a model data and a view template. 
10. Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)  
    HttpServlet, JSP, WebSocketServlet, AsyncContextServlet, SingleThreadModelServlet, etc.
11. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)  
    Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss(WildFly), GlassFish, Resin, WebSphere, Grizzly, Nginx, etc.
12. clone this repo, and run it in you local.  
     a. https://github.com/TAIsRich/springmvc5-demo  
     b. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself. tutorial in the slides.  
     c. find out the APIs in controller and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.  
     d. remember to create a database for this project  
     e. all details in the slides
