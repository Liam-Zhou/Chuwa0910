*******************************************
Q1. List all annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md

See update in annotations.md
*******************************************
Q2. What is the @configuration and @bean?

@Configuration: This annotation is used on classes that define beans.
@Bean: declare a method as a bean definition, allowing the Spring container to manage the lifecycle of the object returned by that method.
*******************************************
Q3. How do you handle the exception in Spring? 

Use @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler

1.  create ErrorDetails Class
2.  Create GlobalExceptionHandler Class
3.  Test using Postman Client
*******************************************
Q4. How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotations you know.

Add dependency: 
        
    <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.0</version>
    </dependency>
Add validation Rule to payload (DTO)
Add @valid to controller to apply the Rule
> Custom Validation Response: in GlobalExceptionHandler Class 
*******************************************
Q5. What is the actuator?

Actuator is a Spring Boot module, which adds REST/JMX endpoints to your application,
so you can easily `monitor` and manage it in production.

Dependency:
pom.xml

        <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-
        actuator</artifactId>
        </dependency>

application.properties
        
        management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
*******************************************
Q6. What is MVC pattern? 

Spring Web MVC is the original web framework built on the Servlet API and has been
included in the Spring Framework from the very beginning. 

Pattern: 
1. Controller: The front controller maps the incoming request to a controller. Controllers contain the
   business logic of the application.
2. Model: Model is a container for data. It is used to transfer data from one part of the Spring MVC
   application to another.
3. View: The view is responsible for rendering the model data and in general it generates HTML output
   that the client's browser can interpret.
*******************************************
Q7. What is Front-controller? 

The front controller design pattern means that all requests that come for a resource in an application will be handled by a single handler and then dispatched to the appropriate handler for that type of request.
*******************************************
Q8. What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works.

DispatcherServlet abstracts away the following tedious and boilerplate tasks and focus on
useful business logic:
1. Mapping an HTTP request to a certain processing method
2. Parsing of HTTP request data and headers into data transfer objects (DTOs)or
domain objects
3. Model-view-controller interaction
4. Generation of responses from DTOs, domain objects, etc

理解： 
1.  Tomcat 收到Http Request，将request交给DispatcherServlet来处理
2.  DispatcherServlet 拿着该req去call HandlerMapper,
3.  HanlerMapper将会找到对应的Controller以及对应的method，并返回给
    dispactherServlet
4.  dispatcherServlet将call该Controller对应的method，此时会触发call service,
    repository and database.
5.  然后结果(ModelAndView)再通过Controller返回。一般是返回view name, 一个字
    符串，比如list-customers. 而数据是要set到Model 中。
6.  dispatcerServlet拿着view name去call view Resolver,
7. View Resolver会帮助我们找到view template, 比如list-customers.jsp
8.  此时我们有了view template, 也有了数据model，则可以call View engine去帮助我
    们把数据放到view templatel里，然后转换成纯粹的HTML
9.  该HTML就是前端显示的内容，最终返回给browser。
*******************************************
Q9. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView? please google to have a basic knowledge.

JSP: Java Server Pages, is a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but it uses the Java programming language.
*******************************************
Q10. List any other servlets. Name with a word description. 

HttpServlet: A base class for creating HTTP-specific servlets, it handles HTTP requests and provides methods for handling various HTTP methods like GET, POST, etc.

GenericServlet: An abstract class for generic servlets, primarily used for non-HTTP protocols, providing a basic framework for handling requests and responses.

JSP (JavaServer Pages): JSPs are not technically servlets, but they work alongside them. They allow embedding Java code within HTML pages, enabling dynamic web content generation.

Filter: Servlet Filters are used to perform filtering tasks on requests and responses, such as authentication, logging, or modifying request/response data before it reaches the servlet.

Listener: Servlet Listeners are used for event handling in a web application. They can respond to application-level events like servlet context initialization or session attribute changes.

AsyncServlet: An asynchronous servlet allows handling of asynchronous HTTP requests, which is useful for improving web application performance by handling long-running operations without blocking the server.

RequestDispatcher: This interface provides methods for including or forwarding requests from one servlet to another, enabling servlet collaboration and modularization.

SingleThreadModel: An interface, now deprecated, that was used to ensure that only one thread can execute a servlet at a time, which is not recommended for modern servlet development due to performance issues.

*******************************************
Q11. How many web server do you know?

Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish, JBoss, WebLogic, WebSphere, Resin, Caucho, WildFly, Undertow
