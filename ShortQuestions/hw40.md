## Database

### MySQL Database Exercise

#### 1. annotations.md
    
#### 2. explain how the below annotaitons specify the table in database?

    @Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'")
    private String name;
    @Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false)
    private String studentName;

**@Column** in JPA are used to specify details about how a Java class field should be mapped to a database column. 

**columnDefinition**: Specifies the SQL fragment that is used when generating the DDL for the column. In this case, it defines a VARCHAR column with a maximum length of 255 characters and a default value of 'John Snow'.

**name**: Specifies the name of the column in the database. In this case, the column name will be "STUDENT_NAME" instead of the default derived from the field name.

**length**: (Optional) Specifies the column length. In this case, it's set to 50 characters.

**nullable**: (Optional) Specifies whether the column is nullable. In this case, it is set to false, meaning that the column cannot have a null value.

**unique**: (Optional) Specifies whether the column should be marked as a unique constraint. In this case, it is set to false, meaning that duplicate values are allowed.


#### 3. What is the default column names of the table in database for @Column ?

    @Column
    private String firstName;
    @Column
    private String operatingSystem;

**first_name** and **operating_system**

#### 4. What are the layers in springboot application? what is the role of each layer?
1. **Presentation Layer**: 
The presentation layer handles the HTTP requests, translates the JSON parameter to object, and authenticates the request and transfer it to the business layer. In short, it consists of views i.e., frontend part.

2. **Business Layer**:
The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of service classes and uses services provided by data access layers. It also performs authorization and validation.

3. **Persistence Layer**:
The persistence layer contains all the storage logic and translates business objects from and to database rows.

4. **Database Layer**:
In the database layer, CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations are performed.

#### 5. Describe the flow in all of the layers if an API is called by Postman.

1. **Presentation Layer (Controller):** The request is received by a controller. The controller is responsible for handling HTTP requests. Input validation and transformation may occur in the controller.
2. **Service Layer**: The controller invokes a service method. The service layer contains the business logic.
Business logic includes processing the request, applying rules, and interacting with the data access layer.
3. **Data Access Layer (Repository)**: The service layer interacts with a repository (data access layer) to perform database operations.
The repository translates the high-level method calls from the service layer into low-level database operations.
4. **Domain Model (Entity)**:
The data access layer may involve JPA entities or POJOs representing the core business entities.
Entities may be loaded, modified, or persisted to the database.
5. **Integration Layer**: If the application needs to interact with external services, APIs, or messaging systems, this layer handles the communication.
Integration logic is encapsulated in separate classes or components.
6. **Configuration Layer**: Configuration classes may set up beans, define application properties, or configure third-party components.
This layer ensures that the application is properly configured before execution.
7. **Security Layer**: If the API requires authentication and authorization, the security layer comes into play.
Security filters and authentication providers are involved in ensuring secure access.
8. **Utility Layer**: Utility classes may be used throughout the application for common functionalities.
Helper methods or utility classes provide reusable functionalities.
9. **Presentation Layer (Controller - Response)**: The response is generated by the controller after the service layer completes its processing.
The response is sent back to the client (Postman in this case).

    
#### 6. What is the application.properties? do you know application.yml?
**application.properties** and **application.yml** are configuration files used in Spring Boot applications to customize various settings. They provide a convenient way to externalize configuration, allowing you to modify the behavior of your application without changing the code. Both files serve the same purpose, but they have different syntax.

    # application.properties

    # Database Configuration
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
    spring.datasource.username=myuser
    spring.datasource.password=mypassword

    # Server Configuration
    server.port=8080
    server.servlet.context-path=/myapp

    ---------------------------------------------------

    # application.yml

    # Database Configuration
    spring:
    datasource:
        url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
        username: myuser
        password: mypassword

    # Server Configuration
    server:
    port: 8080
    servlet:
        context-path: /myapp

#### 7. Create a Project, name it with mongo-blog, write a POST API for mongo-blog, change database MongoDB
