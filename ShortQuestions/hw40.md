1. answer in the annotations.md
2. explain how the below annotaitons specify the table in database?
```
@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'")
private String name;
@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false)
private String studentName;
```
3. What is the default column names of the table in database for @Column ?<br>
In JPA, when you use the @Column annotation to map an entity field to a database column, the default column name in the database is typically derived from the field name.
```
@Column
private String firstName;
@Column
private String operatingSystem;
```
4. What are the layers in springboot application? what is the role of each layer?<br>
A typical Spring Boot application follows a layered architecture, where different layers have specific responsibilities. Each layer serves a distinct purpose in organizing and managing the application's functionality and components<br>
   <br>

   Presentation Layer (Controller):Role: The presentation layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, and returning HTTP responses.Components: Controllers are the primary components in this layer. They receive requests, invoke business logic, and return responses. They may also handle view rendering in web applications.<br>
   <br>
   
   Service Layer (Business Logic Layer):Role: The service layer contains the business logic and acts as an intermediary between the presentation and data access layers. It encapsulates the application's core functionality. Components: Service classes implement business logic and often use data access objects (DAOs) or repositories to interact with the database. They are typically transactional and may contain methods that represent use cases.<br>
   <br>

   Data Access Layer (Persistence Layer):Role: The data access layer is responsible for interacting with the database or any other data source. It manages database connections, executes queries, and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Components: Repositories or DAOs (Data Access Objects) are used in this layer. Spring Data JPA or other persistence frameworks simplify data access code.
   <br>

   Domain or Model Layer:Role: The domain or model layer defines the application's data structures, including entities, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and validation rules. It represents the core data model of the application. Components: Entity classes, DTOs, validation annotations, and related objects reside in this layer.
   <br>

   
5. Describe the flow in all of the layers if an API is called by Postman.<br>
   First, when your spring-boot application starts without errors, the API call will first go to action(controller), Second, the controller will invoke service to find the business logic. Third, the service will invoke the dao layer to access the database finally, if successful grabbing data from the database will return the value to dao->service->controller-> User interface to presentation.<br>


6. What is the application.properties? do you know application.yml?<br>
   Both application.properties and application.yml in a Spring Boot application. They are configuration files that allow you to customize the behavior of your Spring Boot application.application.properties is a text-based configuration file typically located in the src/main/resources directory of your Spring Boot project. It uses a key-value pair format to specify configuration properties. application.yml is an alternative configuration file format that is also located in the src/main/resources directory. It uses a more human-readable YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) syntax for configuration. YAML is known for its simplicity and readability, making it a preferred choice for configuration files, especially when dealing with complex and nested properties.<br>


7. Create a Project, name it with mongo-blog, write a POST API for mongo-blog, change database to MongoDB;1. https://www.mongodb.com/compatibility/spring-boot
