The following is a list of the Spring Boot annotations that I have learned about:

* `@SpringBootApplication`: This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It combines the @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan annotations with their default attributes.
* `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: This annotation tells Spring Boot to automatically configure beans based on the dependencies that are present on the classpath.
* `@ComponentScan`: This annotation tells Spring Boot to scan a specific package or packages for classes annotated with @Component or other Spring annotations.
* `@Component`: This annotation marks a class as a bean to be managed by Spring.
* `@Service`: This annotation marks a class as a service bean. Service beans typically provide business logic for an application.
* `@Repository`: This annotation marks a class as a repository bean. Repository beans typically provide access to data storage.
* `@Controller`: This annotation marks a class as a web controller bean. Controller beans typically handle HTTP requests.
* `@Autowired`: This annotation tells Spring to automatically inject a dependency into a bean.
* `@Qualifier`: This annotation is used to specify a specific bean to inject when there are multiple beans of the same type.
* `@Bean`: This annotation is used to define a bean in a Java configuration class.
* `@Configuration`: This annotation marks a class as a Java configuration class.
* `@Scope`: This annotation is used to specify the scope of a bean.
* `@Lazy`: This annotation tells Spring to initialize a bean lazily, i.e., when it is first requested.
* `@RequestMapping`: This annotation is used to map a request path to a handler method in a controller.
* `@RequestParam`: This annotation is used to bind request parameters to method arguments.
* `@PathVariable`: This annotation is used to bind path variables to method arguments.
* `@RequestBody`: This annotation is used to bind the request body to a method argument.
* `@ResponseBody`: This annotation is used to write the response body directly from a method.
