1. how do you debug ?
  
   To debug code, I follow these steps:

* Identify the problem. What is the code supposed to do, and what is it actually doing? What is the error message, if any?
* Isolate the problem. Where in the code is the problem occurring? This may involve narrowing down the problem to a specific line of code or function.
* Reproduce the problem. Once I have isolated the problem, I try to reproduce it consistently. This helps me to ensure that I am actually debugging the correct problem.
* Understand the code. I take some time to understand the code around the problem. This helps me to identify the potential causes of the problem.
* Use debugging tools. I use debugging tools to step through the code line by line and inspect the values of variables. This helps me to identify the exact line of code where the problem is occurring.
