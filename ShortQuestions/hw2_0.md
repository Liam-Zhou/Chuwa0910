## Homework 2.0

1. **Write up Example code to demonstrate the three foundmental concepts of OOP. (reference Code Demo repo as example)**
    - Encapsulation (data hiding, using getter and setter)
    ```
    class Circle {
        private int area;
        public int getArea() {
            return area;
        }
        public void setArea(int a) {
            this.area = a;
        }
    }
    
    ```
    - Inheritance (extends, super, override, overload, implement)
    ```
    class Shape {
        public void print() {
            System.out.println("This is a shape");
        }
    }
    class Circle extends Shape {
        @Override
        public void print() {
            System.out.println("This is a circle");
        }
    }
    ```
    - Polymorphism (overload, override, implement, abstract)
    ```
    class Shape {
        public void print() {
            System.out.println("This is a shape");
        }
    }
    class Circle extends Shape {
        private int area;

        public Circle() {
            super();
        }
        public Circle(int radius) {
            super();
            this.area = radius * radius * 3.14;
        }
        @Override
        public void print() {
            System.out.println("This is a circle");
        }
    }
    ```
2. **What is wrapper class in Java and Why we need wrapper class?**
    - Wrapper class is a way to convert primitive data type to object (wrapping data). 
    - Since Java is a completely object-oriented language, we need to convert primitive data type to object in order to use them in object-oriented way.

3. **What is the difference between HashMap and HashTable?**
    - HashMap is not synchronized, and thread-safe (but faster), while HashTable is synchronized, and thread-safe (but slower).
    - HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values, while HashTable does not allow null key or null value.

4. **What is String pool in Java and why we need String pool?**
    - String Pool is a storage in Java in order to store String literals and avoid creating duplicate String objects.
    - String Pool is used to save memory and improve performance.
    - However, if we use "new" keyword to create String object, it will not be stored in String Pool.

5. **What is Java garbage collection?**
    - In Java, the objects that are no longer used by the program are automatically deleted by the garbage collector, instead of manually deleting them in C/C++.

6. **What are access modifiers and their scopes in Java?**
    - Access modifiers are keywords to describe the accessibility of a class, method, or variable, including public > protected > default > private.
    - Public: accessible everywhere
    - Protected: accessible in the same class, same package and subclasses
    - Default: accessible in the same class and same package
    - Private: accessible in the same class

7. **What is final key word? (Filed, Method, Class)**
    - final is used like const in C/C++, which means the value cannot be changed.
    - final field: the value cannot be changed
    - final method: the method cannot be overridden
    - final class: the class cannot be inherited

8. **What is static keyword? (Filed, Method, Class). When do we usually use it?**
    - static is used to declare a field, method, or class belongs to the class, instead of the instance.
    - static field: the value is shared by all instances of the class
    - static method: the method can be called without creating an instance of the class, usually used for utility methods or modifying static fields
    - static class: the class cannot be instantiated
    - when we want to use a method or field without creating an instance of the class, we can use static keyword.

9. **What is the differences between overriding and overloading?**
    - Overriding: same method name, same parameter, used in child class to override the method in the parent class
    - Overloading: same method name, different parameter, used in the same class to provide different implementations of the same method

10. **What is the differences between super and this?**
    - super: is used to to call the constructor, method, or field in the parent class
    - this: is used to call the constructor, method, or field in the same class

11. **What is the Java load sequence?**
    - The sequence of loading Java class is: static field > static block > constructor > method

12. **What is Polymorphism ? And how Java implements it ?**
    - Polymorphism is the ability of an object to have multiple forms.
    - Java implements polymorphism by using method overloading and method overriding.

13. **What is Encapsulation ? How Java implements it? And why we need encapsulation?**
    - Encapsulation is the feature that wraps data and code together as a single unit, but hides the implementation details from the user.
    - Java implements encapsulation by using access modifiers (public, protected, default, private).
    - We need encapsulation to prevent the user from accessing and modifying the sensitive data directly, making it maintainable and secure.

14. **What is Interface and what is abstract class? What are the differences between them?**
    - Interface is a contract that specifies methods that its implementing classes must provide.
    - Abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can serve as a base for other classes.
    - Differences:
        - Interface can only have abstract methods, while abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
        - Multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class, while a class can only inherit from one abstract class.
        - All interface methods are implicitly public; abstract class methods can have different access modifiers.
        - Abstract classes can provide some method implementations, while interfaces cannot (until Java 8).

15. **Design a parking lot System**
16. **What are Queue interface implementations and what are the differences and when to use what?**
    - Queue interface implementations: LinkedList, PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque
    - Differences:
        - LinkedList: doubly linked list, can be used as a queue, stack, or list, O(1) insertion and deletion, O(n) access (not random access)
        - PriorityQueue: priority queue, elements are ordered by their natural ordering or by a Comparator, O(log(n)) insertion and deletion, O(1) access
        - ArrayDeque: resizable array, can be used as a queue, stack, or deque, O(1) insertion and deletion, O(1) access
    - When to use what:
        - LinkedList: when we need to insert or delete elements frequently
        - PriorityQueue: when we need to get the smallest or largest element frequently
        - ArrayDeque: when we need to insert or delete elements frequently, but we also need random access
