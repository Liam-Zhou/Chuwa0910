Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that provides a way to modularize cross-cutting concerns separate from the main business logic of the application. Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple modules and are often difficult to modularize using traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques. 

4.
Advantages of Spring AOP:

Separation of Concerns: Spring AOP allows for the clear separation of cross-cutting concerns (like logging, transactions, security, etc.) from the main business logic. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.
Reusability: Aspects can be applied across multiple parts of an application or even across different applications. This means that you can write an aspect once and use it in multiple places, promoting code reusability.
Easier Maintenance: With cross-cutting concerns modularized into separate aspects, it becomes easier to update or modify these concerns without affecting the main business logic.

Disadvantages of Spring AOP:

Performance Overhead: While the overhead is generally minimal, introducing AOP can lead to a slight performance cost, especially if applied extensively.
Complexity: For developers unfamiliar with AOP concepts, there's a learning curve. Introducing AOP can make the application harder to understand initially.
Limited to Method Interception: Spring AOP is proxy-based, which means it's largely limited to method-level interception. For finer-grained control or field-level aspects, one might need to resort to full-fledged AOP frameworks like AspectJ.
Proxy Limitations: Since Spring AOP relies on proxies (by default JDK dynamic proxies or CGLIB proxies), there are limitations. For instance, calling a method within the same class won't trigger the AOP interceptors as it bypasses the proxy.

an "Aspect" is a module that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern. Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple modules and often cannot be modularized using traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques without causing code duplication or scattering

6.
Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not

7.
A join point is a specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values, etc

8.
Advice: action taken by an aspect at a particular join point.
Before Advice (@Before)
After Returning Advice (@AfterReturning)
After Throwing Advice (@AfterThrowing)
After (finally) Advice (@After)
Around Advice (@Around)

reading a file into a database or running a stored procedure
High volume use cases (such as moving high volumes of data between databases, transforming it, and so on)

11.
A Batch process consists of a Job. This entity encapsulates the entire batch process.
A Job can consist of one or more Steps. Steps. In most cases, a Step will read data (via ItemReader), process the data (using the ItemProcessor), and then write the data (via ItemWriter).
The JobLauncher handles starting a Job (Job).
Finally, the JobRepository stores information about the configuration and execution of the Job (Job) configured and executed.

12.
Using Spring's Task Scheduling

Using the @EnableScheduling annotation.
Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job. Then add the job execution logic inside this method


13.
A cron expression is a string representing a schedule in time-based job-scheduling format. It's used by cron (Unix-based job scheduler) and many other scheduling tools and platforms to define recurring time intervals for executing specific tasks

Minutes (0 - 59)
Hours (0 - 23)
Day of the month (1 - 31)
Month (1 - 12 OR Jan-Dec)
Day of the week (0 - 7, where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday OR Sun-Sat)
(Optional) Year (1970 - 2099, not always supported)

14.
Spring Task is a part of the Spring Framework that provides capabilities to program and configure tasks that run in the background. It provides abstractions around task scheduling, asynchronous method execution, and even complex batch processing

15.
Spring Task is particularly useful when you need simple asynchronous processing or task scheduling capabilities in your application without the complexity of a full-fledged job management system like Spring Batch or an external scheduler like Quartz

16.
In the context of web applications, a filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource, the response from a resource, or both. Filters can perform many different tasks, such as Logging.

Example:
public class AuthenticationFilter implements Filter {
    
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
        // Initialization code, if needed
    }

    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {

        HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;
        HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;
        
        // Check if the session contains an attribute "user" (this is just a basic example, real-world apps would have more complex logic)
        if (httpRequest.getSession().getAttribute("user") == null) {
            // User is not authenticated, redirect to login page
            httpResponse.sendRedirect("login.jsp");
        } else {
            // User is authenticated, continue request
            chain.doFilter(request, response);
        }
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup resources, if needed
    }
}

Interceptors help us ensure to process all HTTP requests and responses before sending or getting the request, giving us the power to manage communication

What can we do with an Interceptor?

Modify Request and Response: Before a request reaches its intended handler or after the handler has executed, you can modify request and response objects.

Logging and Monitoring: Track incoming requests, measure execution times, monitor API access frequency, etc.
Authentication and Authorization: Check if a user is authenticated or if they have the right permissions to access a resource.
CORS Handling: Handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configurations.
Error Handling: Handle exceptions and return custom error messages or views.

18.
preHandle: This method is called before the target handler method (like a controller's action method) is invoked.
postHandle:This method is called after the handler method has been invoked but before the view is rendered.

preHandle method is primarily for preparing and setting up, or for stopping the execution based on certain conditions, while the postHandle method is for finalizing things after the handler's execution but before the response is sent to the client.

19.
Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) that can help you design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. Essentially, it provides a framework to define APIs in a standard format, which allows both humans and machines to understand the capabilities of a service without accessing its source code or seeing further documentation.
