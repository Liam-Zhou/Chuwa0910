3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?<br>
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that complements and enhances object-oriented programming (OOP). AOP focuses on modularizing concerns or aspects that cut across different parts of an application, such as logging, security, transaction management, error handling, and performance monitoring. These cross-cutting concerns can lead to code duplication and tangled code in traditional OOP, making maintenance and understanding of the codebase challenging. AOP provides a way to encapsulate these concerns separately from the main business logic, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.<br>


4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?<br>
Advantages of Spring AOP:<br>
Modularity and Reusability: Spring AOP allows you to modularize cross-cutting concerns, making it easier to manage and reuse aspects like logging, security, and transactions across your application.<br>
Separation of Concerns: It promotes the separation of concerns, which leads to cleaner and more maintainable code. Business logic is decoupled from cross-cutting concerns.<br>
Code Consistency: It helps in maintaining code consistency. For example, you can ensure that logging or security-related code is consistent throughout the application.<br>
Flexibility: Spring AOP offers different types of advice (e.g., before, after, around), allowing developers to choose the most appropriate approach for a specific use case.<br>
Disadvantages of Spring AOP:<br>
Limited in Aspect Expressiveness: Spring AOP has limitations compared to more advanced AOP frameworks like AspectJ. It may not handle complex pointcut expressions and join points as comprehensively as AspectJ does.<br>
Runtime Weaving Overhead: Spring AOP primarily uses proxy-based AOP and runtime weaving, which can introduce some runtime performance overhead, especially in applications with a large number of proxied objects.<br>
Aspect Complexity: If aspects become too complex or numerous, it may lead to a loss of code readability, defeating the purpose of AOP.<br>


5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?<br>
aspect is a module or class that encapsulates a specific concern or cross-cutting behavior. Aspects are a fundamental concept in AOP and are used to address cross-cutting concerns in an application. Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple modules or parts of an application and are often difficult to modularize using traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques. Examples of cross-cutting concerns include logging, security, transaction management, error handling, and performance monitoring.<br>


6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?<br>
a "pointcut" is an expression or pattern that defines a set of join points where advice should be applied. Pointcuts specify when and where in your application's execution flow an aspect's advice should be executed. They allow you to selectively target specific methods or parts of your code for cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, or transaction management.<br>


7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?<br>
"join point" is a specific point in the execution of a program where an aspect's advice can be applied. Join points represent various events or execution locations within your application, such as method invocations, object instantiations, field access, exception handling, and more. Join points are the specific points where the aspect's advice, defined in an aspect, is executed.<br>


8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?<br>
advice refers to the actual code that is executed at specified join points in your application. Advice represents the behavior associated with an aspect. When you create an aspect, you define one or more pieces of advice that determine what should happen at specific points in your application's execution. Advice can be executed before, after, or around a join point, and it allows you to inject additional behavior or logic into your application without modifying the core business logic.<br>

10. When to use Spring Batch?<br>
Large Data Processing,ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Operations,Scheduled or Periodic Tasks,Data Import/Export,Parallel Processing,Error Handling and Recovery,Logging and Auditing,Complex Workflows,Scaling and Performance,Maintenance and Monitoring<br>


11. How Spring Batch works?<br>
Step - A Step that delegates to a Job to do its work. This is a great tool for managing dependencies between jobs, and also to modularise complex step logic into something that is testable in isolation. The job is executed with parameters that can be extracted from the step execution, hence this step can also be usefully used as the worker in a parallel or partitioned execution.<br>
ItemReader - Strategy interface for providing the data. Implementations are expected to be stateful and will be called multiple times for each batch, with each call to read() returning a different value and finally returning null when all input data is exhausted. Implementations need not be thread-safe and clients of a ItemReader need to be aware that this is the case. A richer interface (e.g. with a look ahead or peek) is not feasible because we need to support transactions in an asynchronous batch.<br>
ItemProcessor - Interface for item transformation. Given an item as input, this interface provides an extension point which allows for the application of business logic in an item oriented processing scenario. It should be noted that while it's possible to return a different type than the one provided, it's not strictly necessary. Furthermore, returning null indicates that the item should not be continued to be processed.<br>
ItemStreamWriter - Basic interface for generic output operations. Class implementing this interface will be responsible for serializing objects as necessary. Generally, it is responsibility of implementing class to decide which technology to use for mapping and how it should be configured. The write method is responsible for making sure that any internal buffers are flushed. If a transaction is active it will also usually be necessary to discard the output on a subsequent rollback. The resource to which the writer is sending data should normally be able to handle this itself.<br>


12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?<br>
Spring Batch can be scheduled using Cron Job.<br>

13. What is the cron expression?<br>
A cron expression is a string representing a schedule or time-based job in a human-readable format. It's used to specify when a recurring task or job should run, and it's commonly used in scheduling systems and batch processing. Cron expressions consist of fields that define the time units for seconds, minutes, hours, days of the month, months, and days of the week.<br>


14. What is the spring task?<br>
Spring task generally refers to the scheduling and execution of tasks at specific intervals or times using Spring's scheduling capabilities. This is typically accomplished through the use of the @Scheduled annotation and related features. Spring provides support for task scheduling through the Spring Task Execution and Scheduling framework, which is part of the Spring Core Container. This framework enables you to execute methods at specified intervals or times, making it useful for various purposes, including background jobs, batch processing, and periodic tasks. The key component for scheduling tasks in Spring is the @Scheduled annotation.<br>


15. When to use Spring task?<br>
Automated Batch Jobs,Data Synchronization,Data Backups and Archiving,System Maintenance,Cron Jobs,Monitoring and Metrics Collection,Custom Timed Processes<br>


16. What is Filter and any filter example?<br>
A filter, in the context of software development, is a component or module that processes input data, performs specific operations on that data, and produces output data. Filters are commonly used to transform, validate, or otherwise manipulate data as it flows through a pipeline or a sequence of processing steps. Filters can be found in various types of software, including web applications, image processing applications, and data transformation pipelines. Web filters, which are commonly used in web applications, are a type of filter. They intercept and process HTTP requests and responses as they move between a client and a web server. These filters are often used for tasks like request logging, authentication, authorization, data compression, and input validation.<br>


17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?<br>
Interceptors, in the context of software development, are components or modules that intercept and process requests, events, or method invocations in an application. Interceptors are often used to implement cross-cutting concerns, which are aspects of an application that affect multiple parts of the codebase. Interceptors can be found in various types of software, including web applications, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) frameworks, and middleware systems.<br>
We can use interceptor such as Logging,Authentication and Authorization,Validation,Auditing,Security,Exception Handling<br>

18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?<br>
The preHandle method is called before the actual handler method (controller method) is invoked. It provides an opportunity to perform tasks or checks before the request is processed by the controller. This method can be used for operations such as request logging, authentication checks, authorization checks, or any pre-processing tasks. The preHandle method can also be used to prevent the request from reaching the controller by returning false, in which case the request is stopped and not forwarded to the controller.<br>
The postHandle method is called after the controller has processed the request and generated a response but before the response is sent to the client. It provides an opportunity to perform post-processing tasks on the response, modify the response, or add attributes to the model for use in the view. This method is often used for operations such as request and response logging, adding common attributes to the model, or modifying the response.<br>


19. What is Swagger?<br>
Swagger is an open-source framework that simplifies and streamlines the process of designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a set of tools and conventions for both API developers and consumers to improve the development and interaction with APIs. The primary goals of Swagger are to enhance API discoverability, readability, and testing.<br>
