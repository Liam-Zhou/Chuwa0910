3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
> Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on modularizing cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transactions, in a way that promotes better code organization and reusability. AOP accomplishes this by defining aspects, which are modules encapsulating behavior that can be applied to various parts of an application.
4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
> * Advantages:<br>
Separation of concerns: AOP helps separate cross-cutting concerns from the core business logic, improving code modularity.<br>
Code reusability: Aspects can be reused across different parts of the application.<br>
Improved maintainability: It makes it easier to manage cross-cutting concerns separately.<br>
> * Disadvantages:<br>
Increased complexity: AOP can make code harder to understand due to the scattering of concerns.<br>
Potential runtime issues: Improperly configured aspects can lead to unexpected behavior.<br>
Limited to method-level concerns: AOP typically addresses method-level cross-cutting concerns.<br>

5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
> An aspect in Spring AOP is a module containing advice (interception code) and pointcuts (expressions specifying where to apply the advice). Aspects define cross-cutting concerns and encapsulate related behavior, such as logging or security.
6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
> A pointcut in Spring AOP is an expression that defines where advice should be applied in the application code. It specifies specific join points, such as method executions, that match the pointcut expression. Pointcuts help determine when and where the aspect's advice should be invoked.
7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
> A join point in Spring AOP represents a specific point in the execution of a program, typically a method execution. It is the intersection of an aspect and the application's execution flow, where advice can be applied. Join points are defined by pointcuts.
8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
> Advice in Spring AOP refers to the code that is executed at a specific join point in an application. There are different types of advice:<br>
After returning advice: Executed after a method successfully returns a value.<br>
After throwing advice: Executed after a method throws an exception.<br>
After advice: Executed after the completion of a method, regardless of its outcome.<br>
Around advice: Wraps a method, allowing control over its invocation.<br>

10. When to use Spring Batch?
> Spring Batch is a framework designed for processing large volumes of data efficiently, making it suitable for various batch processing scenarios. You should consider using Spring Batch when you need to:<br>
Process large datasets.<br>
Schedule and automate batch jobs.<br>
Handle complex and transactional processes.<br>
Ensure fault tolerance and recoverability.<br>
Monitor and manage batch job execution.<br>

11. How Spring Batch works?
> Spring Batch is a framework for batch processing in Java. It works by defining a job that consists of one or more steps. Each step involves reading, processing, and writing data. Spring Batch provides components for job scheduling, data reading, processing, and writing, as well as error handling and recovery mechanisms. It operates based on configurations and allows you to execute batch jobs reliably and efficiently.
12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
> You can schedule a Spring Batch job using scheduling tools like the Spring @Scheduled annotation, which allows you to specify a cron expression or a fixed rate for running the job at specific intervals. You can also use external scheduling tools like Quartz or the operating system's task scheduler to trigger Spring Batch jobs.
13. What is the cron expression?
> A cron expression is a string representing a schedule in a human-readable format. It consists of five fields (seconds, minutes, hours, day of the month, month, and day of the week) separated by spaces or tabs. Each field allows you to specify when a task should run. For example, "0 0 * * * *" means to run a task at the start of every hour.
14. What is the spring task?
> It seems there might be a misunderstanding here. "Spring Task" is not a standard term in Spring Framework. You might be referring to "Spring Task Scheduler" or the scheduling capabilities provided by Spring's @Scheduled annotation.
15. When to use Spring task?
> If you meant to refer to Spring's task scheduling features, you can use them when you need to schedule and automate tasks in a Spring application. It is useful for running periodic tasks, such as sending email notifications, cleaning up data, or triggering batch jobs at specific intervals.
16. What is Filter and any filter example?
> In the context of web applications, a filter is a Java component used to intercept and manipulate requests and responses as they flow through the web application. Filters are typically used for tasks like logging, authentication, or modifying request or response data. An example of a filter is the "Character Encoding Filter," which can set the character encoding for request and response objects.
17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
> In a web application, an interceptor is a mechanism provided by frameworks like Spring MVC to perform pre-processing and post-processing tasks on web requests. Interceptors can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, modifying request attributes, and more. You can use interceptors to implement cross-cutting concerns in your application.
18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
> In Spring MVC interceptors, preHandle is a method that is executed before the actual controller method is invoked. It allows you to perform pre-processing tasks, such as authentication or request modification. postHandle is a method executed after the controller method but before the view is rendered. It enables you to perform post-processing tasks, such as modifying the model or view.
19. What is Swagger?
> Swagger is a tool for documenting and testing RESTful APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for developers to view API documentation, interact with API endpoints, and generate client SDKs. Swagger allows you to define API specifications using the OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger Specification). This documentation helps developers understand and consume APIs more easily.
