@Test: This is a JUnit annotation used to mark a method as a test case. The annotated method will be executed by the test runner to verify specific assertions or expectations.

@BeforeAll: This JUnit 5 annotation is used to mark a method that should be run once before all the test methods in a test class. It's typically used for one-time setup tasks.

@BeforeEach: This JUnit 5 annotation is used to mark a method that should be run before each individual test method in a test class. It's often used for setting up common test fixtures.

@AfterAll: In JUnit 5, this annotation is used to mark a method that should be run once after all the test methods in a test class have been executed. It's commonly used for teardown tasks.

@SpringBootTest: This Spring Boot annotation is used to indicate that a test is a Spring Boot integration test. It loads the Spring context and allows you to perform integration testing by running your application within a test environment.

@Mock: This is a Mockito annotation used to create a mock object for a class or interface. Mock objects simulate the behavior of real objects without instantiating them.

@Spy: In Mockito, this annotation is used to create a partial mock object. It converts an existing object into a spy, allowing you to retain the real implementation of methods while specifying mock behavior for others.

@InjectMocks: Also in Mockito, this annotation is used to inject mock objects created with @Mock or @Spy into an instance of the class under test.

@RunWith: In JUnit 4, this annotation was used to specify a custom test runner. However, JUnit 5 uses an extension model instead, and you don't typically use @RunWith with JUnit 5.

@PrepareForTest: This is a PowerMock annotation used in conjunction with PowerMockito. It's used to prepare classes for mocking static methods, constructors, or other behavior that Mockito cannot handle on its own.
