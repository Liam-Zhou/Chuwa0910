    Done.
2.  Type the Comment feature for the class project.    
    Done.
3.  In postman, call of the APIs in PostController and CommentController.  
    Done.
4.  what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?  
    JPA is a specification that defines the Java standard for object-relational mapping, while Hibernate is one of the most popular implementations of JPA.
5.  What is Hikari? what is the benefits of connection pool?  
    Hikari is a popular JDBC connection pool library often used in spring boot. Using connection pool has the following benefits:  
    - Improve performance by not creating new connections everytime program has new request;
    - Easily management database connection resources, like define the minimum connections, maximum connections, etc.
6.  What is the  @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.  
    - `@OneToMany`: define a one-to-many relationship between two entities.
        ```java
        @Entity
        public class Author {
            @Id
            @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
            private Long id;
            private String name;

            @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author")
            private List<Book> books;
        }
        ```
    - `@ManyToOne`: define a many-to-onw relationship between two entities.
        ```java
        @Entity
        public class Book {
            @Id
            @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
            private Long id;
            private String title;

            @ManyToOne
            @JoinColumn(name = "author_id")
            private Author author;
        }
        ```
    - `@ManyToMany`: define a many-to-many relationship between two entities.
        ```java
        @Entity
        public class Student {
            @Id
            @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
            private Long id;
            private String name;

            @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "students")
            private List<Course> courses;
        }
      
        @Entity
        public class Course {
            @Id
            @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
            private Long id;
            private String name;

            @ManyToMany
            @JoinTable(
                name = "student_course",
                joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id"),
                inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id")
            )
            private List<Student> students;
        }
        ```
7.  What is the `cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true`? and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?  
    `cascade` is an attribute that can be set on a relationship annotation (e.g., `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@ManyToMany`, etc.) to specify which operations should be cascaded from the owning entity (parent) to the related entity (child) when a specific operation is performed on the owning entity.
    - `CascadeType.ALL`: Cascades all operations, including persist, merge, remove, refresh, and detach.
    - `CascadeType.PERSIST`: Cascades the persist operation (i.e., saving a new entity).
    - `CascadeType.MERGE`: Cascades the merge operation (i.e., updating an existing entity).
    - `CascadeType.REMOVE`: Cascades the remove operation (i.e., deleting an entity).
    - `CascadeType.REFRESH`: Cascades the refresh operation (i.e., refreshing the state of an entity from the database).
    - `CascadeType.DETACH`: Cascades the detach operation (i.e., detaching an entity from the persistence context).  

    `orphanRemoval` is a boolean attribute that can be set on the owning side of a `@OneToOne` or `@OneToMany` relationship. When set to true, it indicates that if an entity is removed from the relationship (e.g., by setting it to null or removing it from a collection), it should be deleted from the database as well.
8.  What is the  `fetch = FetchType.LAZY`, `fetch = FetchType.EAGER`? what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?  
    `fetch = FetchType.LAZY`: associated entities will not be loaded when you load the parent entity.
    `fetch = FetchType.EAGER`: associated entities are fetched from the database immediately when the owning entity is loaded.
9.  What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?  
    - Table: JPA derives the table name from the entity class name, converting it to uppercase, like class `Book` will be table `BOOK`.
    - Column: JPA derives column names from the field or property names in the entity class, like `titleName` to `TITLE_NAME`.
    - Primary Key: JPA assumes that the primary key column in a table is named `id`.
    - Join Column: JPA uses the field name appended with `_id` as the default foreign key column name, like a field named `author` in a `Book` entity that represents a many-to-one relationship to an `Author` entity, the default foreign key column name in the `Book` table would be `author_id`.  
    We can implement the method by ourselves using annotations like `@Table`, `@Column`, and `@JoinColumn` as below:
    ```java
    @Entity
    @Table(name = "my_custom_books")
    public class Book {
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        @Column(name = "book_id")
        private Long id;

        @Column(name = "book_title")
        private String title;
    }
    ```
10. Try to use JPA advanced methods in your class project. In the repository layer, you need to use the naming convention to use the method provided by JPA.  
Done.
11. (Optional) Check out a new branch(https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-redbook/tree/hw02_01_jdbcTemplate) from branch 02_post_RUD, replace the dao layer using JdbcTemplate.
12. (Optional) use JDBC to read the data from database.
13. type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch 02_post_RUD, name the new branch with https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-redbook/tree/hw05_01_slides_JPQL.  
Done.
14. What is JPQL?  
Java Persistence Query Language, it's a query language inside JPA, to perform relational database query using java.
15. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?  
    `@NamedQuery` is annotation used in JPA to define named query for entity classes. Named queries allow you to pre-define JPQL queries and reference them by name in your Java code.  
    `@NamedQueries` allows you to define multiple named queries for one class.
16. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?  
    `@Query` annotation is used to define custom queries in a repository interface. Both sql and JPQL is accepted.
17. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?    
    HQL is Hibernate Query Language, is a query language provided by Hibernate, which is similar in syntax and purpose to SQL;  
    Criteria Queries, also called Hibernate Criteria API, provide a programmatic and type-safe way to create database queries in Hibernate.
18. What is EntityManager?
    EntityManager is part of JPA, serves as the primary interface for interacting with a relational database. It provides a set of built-in methods for performing CRUD operations.
19. What is SessionFactory and Session?
    SessionFactory is part of Hibernate, served as configuration and creation point for Sessions. It will create multiple connections with database, and provide services to the applications during the running time.  
    Session is a short-lived, lightweight, and non-thread-safe object representing a single unit of work within Hibernate.
20. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?  
    A transaction is a bunch of database commands that is either completed entirely or not at all. In Hibernate, we use annotations like `@Session` and `@Transactional` to make it transaction.
21. What is hibernate Caching?
    Hibernate Caching is a cache mechanism that improve database performance. 
22. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?  
    First-Level Cache is associated with an individual Hibernate Session; Second-Level Cache is a shared cache that spans multiple sessions. It caches data at the entity level, allowing different sessions to share cached data.
23. How do you understand @Transactional? (不要clone，要自己抄写并测试transactional，https://github.com/TAIsRich/tutorial-transaction)  
    `@Transactional` will make sure all the commands will be executed within one database transaction, meaning it will be committed to database once every command is done, or rollback if any step went wrong.
24. Write a simple factory design pattern.
