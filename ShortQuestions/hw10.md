1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md.


2. What is the @configuration and @bean?

    1. @Configuration
       
       @Configuration is a class-level annotation in Spring Framework, indicating that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions. A class annotated with @Configuration typically includes one or more @Bean-annotated methods to instantiate and configure dependencies within the Spring application context.

       Here’s the breakdown:

       - Class-Level Annotation: @Configuration is used to annotate a class.
       - Bean Definitions Source: Indicates that a class provides one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.

       Example:
       ```
       @Configuration
       public class AppConfig {

          @Bean
          public MyService myService() {
              return new MyServiceImpl();
          }
       }
       ```
       In this example, the AppConfig class is annotated with @Configuration, indicating that it's a configuration class that may have @Bean methods.

    2. @Bean
       
       @Bean is a method-level annotation in the Spring Framework, which is used to indicate that a method returns a bean to be managed and configured by the Spring container. It’s used within a class annotated with @Configuration.

       Here’s the breakdown:

       - Method-Level Annotation: @Bean is used on methods.
       - Bean Producer: Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.
       
       Example (continued from above):
       ```
       @Configuration
       public class AppConfig {

          @Bean
          public MyService myService() {
             return new MyServiceImpl();
          }
       }
       ```
       In this continued example, the myService() method is annotated with @Bean, indicating that it returns a bean to be managed by the Spring container. The myService() method returns a new instance of MyServiceImpl. Spring will ensure that this bean is instantiated, configured, and managed in the application context.
       
       However, when there are multiple beans of the same type, Spring's dependency injection needs more information to determine which bean to inject. If we try to @Autowired a MyService and there are two qualifying beans (myService() and myService2()), Spring will throw a NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException as it won't be able to make a decision on which bean to inject.
       
       There are several ways to handle this situation:
       
       1. Use @Primary Annotation
       
          We can annotate one of the @Bean methods with @Primary to indicate that it should be given precedence when multiple beans of the same type exist.

          ```
          @Configuration
          public class AppConfig {

             @Bean
             @Primary
             public MyService myService() {
                return new MyServiceImpl();
             }

             @Bean
             public MyService myService2() {
                return new MyServiceImpl2();
             }
          }
          ```
       
       2. Use @Qualifier Annotation
       
          We can use the @Qualifier annotation to specify the name of the bean that should be injected.
          
          ```
          @Autowired
          @Qualifier("myService2")
          private MyService myService;
          ```
       
       3. Use Resource Annotation with Name
       
          Similar to @Qualifier, we can use @Resource annotation and provide the name of the bean.
          
          ```
          @Resource(name="myService2")
          private MyService myService;
          ```
       
       4. Autowire a List of Beans

          If we want, we can also autowire a list of all beans of the same type and then decide programmatically which one to use.
          
          ```
          @Autowired
          private List<MyService> myServices;
          ```

3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?

    1. Using @ExceptionHandler
       
       In the controller, we can use the @ExceptionHandler annotation to define a method to handle exceptions thrown by request mapping methods.
       
       ```
       @Controller
       public class MyController {

          @RequestMapping("/doSomething")
          public String doSomething() {
             // ...
             throw new MyException("Something went wrong");
          }

          @ExceptionHandler(MyException.class)
          public ModelAndView handleException(MyException e) {
             ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("error");
             mav.addObject("message", e.getMessage());
             return mav;
          }
       }
       ```
       
       In this example, if doSomething() method throws a MyException, the handleException() method will handle it.

    2. Using @ControllerAdvice
       
       For global exception handling, we can use @ControllerAdvice. This allows us to handle exceptions across all controllers.
       
       ```
       @ControllerAdvice
       public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

          @ExceptionHandler(MyException.class)
          public ModelAndView handleMyException(MyException e) {
             ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("error");
             mav.addObject("message", e.getMessage());
             return mav;
          }

          @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
          public ModelAndView handleGeneralException(Exception e) {
             ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("general-error");
             mav.addObject("message", "An error occurred");
             return mav;
          }
       }
       ```
       
       In this example, handleMyException() will handle MyException thrown from any controller, and handleGeneralException() will catch all other exceptions.

    3. Using @ResponseStatus
       
       We can also use @ResponseStatus to specify the HTTP status code that should be returned with the response.
       
       ```
       @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, reason = "Request Invalid")
       public class RequestInvalidException extends RuntimeException {
          // ...
       }
       ```
       
       In this case, whenever RequestInvalidException is thrown, Spring will return a response with the HTTP status code BAD_REQUEST (400) and the specified reason message.

4. How do you do the validations in Spring? And list some validation annotaitons you know.

    In Spring, validation is typically performed using the Bean Validation API and its implementation, for instance, Hibernate Validator. We annotate domain/model classes with constraint annotations on fields to specify constraints, and Spring will ensure those constraints are met at runtime when the object is validated.

    How to Perform Validation
    
    1. Annotate Model Class
       
       Annotate the fields of our model class with constraint annotations.
       
       ```
       public class User {
    
          @NotBlank(message = "Name cannot be empty")
          private String name;

          @Email(message = "Email should be valid")
          private String email;

          @Min(value = 18, message = "Age should not be less than 18")
          @Max(value = 150, message = "Age should not be greater than 150")
          private int age;

          // getters and setters
       }
       ```
       
    2. Enable Validation in Controller
       
       Add @Valid annotation before the @RequestBody annotation in the controller method to trigger validation.
       
       ```
       @RestController
       @RequestMapping("/users”)
       public class UserController {

          @PostMapping
          public ResponseEntity<String> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user) {
             // processing
             return ResponseEntity.ok("User created successfully");
          }
       }
       ```
    
    3. Handle Validation Errors
       
       Use @ExceptionHandler method or a @ControllerAdvice class to handle MethodArgumentNotValidException which is thrown when validation fails.
       
       ```
       @ControllerAdvice
       public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

          @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
          public ResponseEntity<List<String>> handleValidationExceptions(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
             List<String> errors = ex.getBindingResult()
                   .getAllErrors().stream()
                   .map(ObjectError::getDefaultMessage)
                   .collect(Collectors.toList());

             return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(errors);
          }
       }
       ```
    
    Common Validation Annotations
    
    - @NotNull: The annotated element must not be null.
    - @NotEmpty: The annotated element must not be null or empty; can be used on String, Collection, Map, and arrays.
    - @NotBlank: The annotated string must not be null and must contain at least one non-whitespace character.
    - @Size(min=, max=): The annotated element’s size must be between the specified min and max.
    - @Min(): The annotated number must be equal to or greater than the specified minimum value.
    - @Max(): The annotated number must be equal to or less than the specified maximum value.
    - @Email: The annotated string must be a well-formed email address.
    - @Pattern(regex=, flags=): The annotated string must match the specified regular expression.
    
5. What is the actuator?

    The Actuator is a tool provided by Spring Boot that helps us monitor and manage our application. Actuators enable production-ready features to a Spring Boot application – without having to actually implement these things ourself. Actuators are mainly used to expose operational information about the running application – health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. It uses HTTP, JMX, or SSH endpoints to enable us to interact with it.

    Key Features of Spring Boot Actuator:
     
    - Health Check: Provide health information of the app. It shows the application’s health and its various components, like database, disk space, custom checks, etc.
    - Metrics: Give insights into the various metrics like memory, heap, JVM, garbage collection, and various others, which can be extremely useful to monitor the performance of the app.
    - Application Environment: Expose various environment properties.
    - Other Features: Apart from the above, it provides features like viewing configured properties, making thread dump, viewing auto-configured beans, viewing application info, etc.

    How to Include Actuator in a Spring Boot Application:
    
    - Add Dependency: Include the Spring Boot Actuator dependency in the pom.xml or build.gradle file.

      Maven example:
    
      ```
      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
      </dependency>
      ```
    
      Gradle example:
    
      ```
      implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'  
      ```
    
    - Properties Configuration: Configure the properties if necessary in the application.properties or application.yml file to enable, disable or customize endpoints.
      
      ```
      management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
      management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
      ```
    
    - Access the Endpoints: Once the application is running, you can access various endpoints provided by the actuator. For example, access the /actuator/health endpoint to get the health status of the application.
     
      ```
      GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
      ```
    
    Common Actuator Endpoints:
    
    - /actuator/health: Shows application health information.
    - /actuator/info: Displays arbitrary application info.
    - /actuator/metrics: Expose metrics information.
    - /actuator/env: Expose environment properties.
    - /actuator/beans: Display a complete list of all the Spring beans in your application.
