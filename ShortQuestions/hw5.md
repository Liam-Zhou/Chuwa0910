### 1. Volatile variables in Java
The volatile keyword in Java is used to mark a variable as being stored in main memory. It ensures changes made by one thread to a shared variable are immediately made visible to other threads. This provides a guarantee about the visibility of variables.
In the Singleton pattern, volatile is often used to ensure that multiple threads handle the singleton instance correctly.

### 2. Create a new thread (including Thread Pool)
Using Thread class:

java

Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Running a new thread!"));
thread.start();
Using ExecutorService for Thread Pool:

java

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); // pool of 10 threads
executor.execute(() -> System.out.println("Running thread from pool!"));
executor.shutdown();
### 3. Difference between Runnable and Callable
Runnable: Represents a task which can be executed asynchronously. It has a run method which does not return a result.

Callable: Represents a task that can be executed asynchronously. It has a call method which returns a result.

### 4. Difference between t.start() and t.run()
t.start(): Creates a new thread and runs the code in the thread's run method.
t.run(): Just calls the run method in the same thread without starting a new thread.
### 5. Which way of creating threads is better: Thread class or Runnable interface?
Using the Runnable interface is generally preferable because it allows the class to extend another class (Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance). It provides better separation of the thread code and the task code.

### 6. Thread Status
Threads can be in one of the following states:

NEW: The thread has been created but has not started.
RUNNABLE: The thread is running or ready to run.
BLOCKED: The thread is waiting to obtain a lock.
WAITING: The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
TIMED_WAITING: The thread is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time.
TERMINATED: The thread has completed execution.
### 7. Difference between wait() and sleep()
wait(): Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() or notifyAll() method for the same object. It's called on an object, not a thread.
sleep(): Causes the current thread to suspend execution for a specified period. It always affects the current thread.
### 8. Deadlock
A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a lock.

### 9. Threads communication
Threads can communicate with each other using methods like wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().

### 10. join() method
The join() method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread.

### 11. yield() method
The yield() method causes the currently executing thread to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.

### 12. Thread Pool
A thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized threads. It's a way to manage the number of threads used by a system. Thread pools can improve performance by managing a set number of threads that can be reused for multiple tasks.

### 13. Executor Framework in Java
The Executor Framework is a framework that provides a higher-level replacement for the traditional way of managing threads in Java. It provides a pool of threads that can be used to execute tasks concurrently.
Types:

FixedThreadPool
CachedThreadPool
ScheduledThreadPool
SingleThreadExecutor
### 14. Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow()
shutdown(): Initiates a graceful shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.
shutdownNow(): Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks and halts the processing of waiting tasks.
### 15. Atomic Classes
Atomic classes, like AtomicInteger or AtomicReference, support lock-free thread-safe programming on single variables. They can be used when you need to change a single variable frequently and require it to be thread-safe.

### 16. Concurrent Collections
Concurrent Collections like ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList are thread-safe collections that provide better scalability and performance compared to synchronized collections.

### 17. Types of Locks
ReentrantLock
ReadWriteLock: ReadLock and WriteLock
StampedLock

### 18. Difference between class lock and object lock
Class Lock: Lock on the class itself. It locks static methods or blocks and is held on the Class object associated with the class.

Object Lock: Lock on an instance of the class. It locks instance methods or blocks and is held on the specific instance of the object.

### 19. Future and CompletableFuture
Future: Represents a result of an asynchronous computation. You can retrieve the result using the get() method, but this method blocks until the computation is done.

CompletableFuture: An enhancement over Future that provides methods to combine multiple asynchronous computations, handle exceptions, and do further processing or action upon completion of the computation.

### 20. ThreadLocal
ThreadLocal is a class that provides thread-local variables. Each thread accessing a ThreadLocal variable has its own independent copy, which is not shared with other threads. It's useful when you want to store data that is specific to a particular thread.
