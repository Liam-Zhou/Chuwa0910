# 9. What is JSP and What is ModelAndViewï¼Ÿ
JSP: JSP is a technology used for building web pages that support dynamic content. It is part of the Java EE suite of technologies, allowing developers to write HTML with embedded Java code. JSP can be thought of as an extension to servlets, offering a more convenient way to generate dynamic HTML content.
ModelAndView: is a container object that holds both the Model and the View. When a controller in Spring MVC handles a request, it can return a ModelAndView object, indicating which view should be used (like a specific JSP page) and what data (model) should be given to that view for rendering the response.
