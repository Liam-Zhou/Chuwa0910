1. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
> Spring is a comprehensive framework for building Java applications. Spring Boot is an extension of Spring that simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications. The benefits of using Spring Boot include rapid application development, auto-configuration, and the ability to create standalone, production-ready applications with minimal setup.
2. What is IOC and What is DI?
> IOC (Inversion of Control) is a design principle where the control over object creation and management is shifted to a container or framework. DI (Dependency Injection) is a specific implementation of IOC, where dependencies are injected into a class from the outside, typically via constructor or setter methods.
3. What is  @CompnonentScan?
> @ComponentScan is an annotation in Spring that is used to specify which packages should be scanned for Spring-managed components (like beans, controllers, services, etc.). It's often used at the application's configuration class to define the base package for component scanning.
4. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
> In XML configuration, you can specify which packages Spring should scan using the <context:component-scan> element. In annotation-based configuration, you can use the @ComponentScan annotation at the configuration class to specify the base package for scanning. For both methods, you specify the package names as parameters.
5. What is  @SpringbootApplication?
> @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation in Spring Boot that combines multiple annotations like @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. It's used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application, allowing it to be discovered by the Spring Boot framework and set up a Spring context, configure beans, and enable various features for a Spring Boot application.
6. How many ways wo can define a bean?
> - Using XML configuration in a Spring context file.
> - Annotating a class with @Component, @Service, or @Repository.
> - Defining a bean method within a @Configuration class using the @Bean annotation.
7. What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
> The default bean name for a class annotated with @Component or defined as a @Bean method is derived from the class name with a lowercase initial letter. For example, a class MyComponent would have a default bean name of myComponent.
8. What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?
> The main difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository is in their intended use. They are all stereotypes for Spring beans and can be used interchangeably in terms of component scanning. However, they carry semantic meaning:
> * @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
> * @Service is typically used for defining services.
> * @Repository is commonly used for defining data access components (like DAOs).

9. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
> There are several annotations to inject beans in Spring, including:
> * @Autowired
> * @Resource // not common
> * @Qualifier
> * @Value

10. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans
    in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
> The three types of dependency injection in Spring are:
> * onstructor injection: Dependencies are injected through a class constructor.
> * Setter injection: Dependencies are injected using setter methods.
> * Field injection: Dependencies are injected directly into class fields.
> <br>Constructor injection is often considered better because it ensures that a bean is always in a valid state when it's created, and it makes dependencies explicit. Setter and field injection can lead to partially initialized objects and may be harder to test.

11. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let
    the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primary.
> To set a bean as primary, you can use the @Primary annotation. If there are multiple beans of the same type, the one marked as primary will be chosen for injection. If there's no primary bean, and you need to specify which one to use, you can use the @Qualifier annotation to indicate the name or identifier of the desired bean. If no primary or qualified bean is available, Spring will throw an exception, indicating an ambiguous dependency.
12. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
> - BeanFactory is the basic interface for accessing Spring beans and is more lightweight. It provides essential bean management features.
> - ApplicationContext is a more feature-rich interface that extends BeanFactory. It adds extra functionality, like event propagation, internationalization, and AOP integration. 
> - ApplicationContext also pre-instantiates singleton beans, making it more suitable for most application scenarios.
13. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
> - Singleton: A single instance of the bean is created for the entire application context.
> - Prototype: A new instance is created each time the bean is requested.
> - Request: A new instance is created for each HTTP request (web applications only).
> - Session: A new instance is created for each HTTP session (web applications only).
> - Global Session: Similar to session scope but for a global HTTP session (portlet applications).
14. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we
    configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml,
    and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old,
    I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
> a Person bean is configured with properties like name and age, and it has a dependency on an Address bean, which is injected using the ref attribute:
```xml
<bean id="personBean" class="com.example.Person">
    <property name="name" value="John" />
    <property name="age" value="30" />
    <property name="address" ref="addressBean" />
</bean>

<bean id="addressBean" class="com.example.Address">
    <property name="city" value="New York" />
    <property name="zipCode" value="10001" />
</bean>

```
