# 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benefits of using Springboot?
Spring: Spring is a powerful and flexible framework focused on building Java-based enterprise applications. It started primarily as a Dependency Injection (DI) container but quickly evolved into a comprehensive framework for building scalable and maintainable applications.
Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a project within the larger Spring ecosystem that simplifies the process of building production-ready applications with Spring. It provides conventions and defaults for application structure and behavior, making it easier and quicker to start new projects.

# 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
IOC: Inversion of Control is a design principle where the control over the flow of an application is inverted, meaning it's taken away from the main routine and handed over to a framework or container. In traditional programming, the main routine or function controls the flow of execution. With IoC, this flow is inverted: the framework or container invokes specific portions of the code as needed.
The primary benefit of IoC is that it promotes decoupling. By allowing a container or framework to control application flow, individual components can remain ignorant of the larger system they're a part of, leading to more modular and maintainable code.

DI: Dependency Injection is a form of IoC where the dependencies of an object (i.e., the services or components it relies on) are "injected" into the object by an external entity, rather than the object creating or finding its dependencies. DI makes testing easier and promotes solid coding principles by ensuring that classes adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (a class should have only one reason to change) and are highly cohesive (related functionality is bundled together).
There are typically three ways to inject dependencies:
Constructor Injection: The dependencies are provided through the object's constructor.
Setter Injection: The dependencies are assigned using setter methods.
Method Injection: The dependencies are provided through methods.

# 4. What is  @ComponentScan?
@ComponentScan is an annotation provided by the Spring framework, primarily used with the Spring core container. It tells Spring where to search for beans/components that are defined and need to be automatically registered in the Spring container.

# 5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotation?
XML:
```
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

    <!-- Scans the specified package and its sub-packages for annotated components -->
    <context:component-scan base-package="com.example.packageName" />

</beans>
```

Component:
```
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.packageName")
public class AppConfig {
    // Other configuration beans
}

@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.example.package1", "com.example.package2"})
```

# 6. What is  @SpringbootApplication?
@SpringBootApplication is an annotation in the Spring Framework used in Java for building Spring Boot applications. It's a combination of several other annotations and is typically placed on the main class of a Spring Boot application to indicate that it's a Spring Boot application.
Here's what each part of @SpringBootApplication represents:
@SpringBootConfiguration: This annotation is used to mark a class as a configuration class. It indicates that the class can be used to define bean definitions and other Spring-related configuration.
@EnableAutoConfiguration: This annotation tells Spring Boot to enable automatic configuration based on the dependencies that are present in your classpath. It helps simplify configuration by automatically configuring various components based on what it detects in your application's classpath.
@ComponentScan: This annotation tells Spring to scan for Spring-managed components (such as beans, controllers, services, etc.) starting from the package where the main application class is located.

# 7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
By using annotation; By using xml; By using @Configuration and @Bean

# 8. What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
For @Component, the default is the class name with its first letter lowercase
For @Bean, the default is the method name with its first letter lowercase

# 9. What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository
while all three annotations (@Component, @Service, and @Repository) can be used to define Spring beans, they provide different semantic meanings to the beans. You can choose the most appropriate annotation based on the role and purpose of the component within your application. Additionally, some Spring features, like component scanning and automatic wiring, can be influenced by these annotations, but fundamentally, they are all used to create and manage Spring beans.

# 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
@Autowired, @Inject, @Resource, @Qualifier, @Value

# 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, Field Injection.
Constructor Injection is better
Constructor injection is generally recommended because it promotes immutability and makes it explicit which dependencies a class requires. It results in objects that are immediately in a valid state when created, making it easier to reason about their behavior and ensuring that all required dependencies are present.

# 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay
If this case happen, we look for the qualifier first to see if any matched bean. If not, we match them by seeing if any @Primary annotation exist, if not, we match them by name.

# 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
BeanFactory is a basic container with core bean management functionality, while ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory with additional features for application-level concerns.
BeanFactory is more lightweight and suitable for resource-constrained environments, whereas ApplicationContext is recommended for most Spring applications due to its richer feature set.
ApplicationContext provides eager initialization of singleton beans, while BeanFactory initializes beans lazily by default.

# 14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
In Spring Framework, the scope of a bean defines the lifecycle and visibility of that bean within the container. Different scopes are used to control how and when beans are created, shared, and destroyed.
Singleton Scope:
In the Singleton scope, Spring creates and manages a single instance of the bean throughout the entire application's lifecycle. All requests for the bean return the same shared instance.
It's the default scope for Spring beans.
Singleton beans are suitable for stateless and thread-safe beans.

Prototype Scope:
In the Prototype scope, a new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested from the container.
Prototype beans are not shared; each request for the bean results in a new instance.
Prototype beans are useful when you need a fresh instance of a bean for each interaction.

Request Scope:
Request scope is used in web applications. A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request.
This scope is available when using the Spring Web framework, such as Spring MVC.
Request-scoped beans are suitable for objects tied to the lifecycle of an HTTP request.

Session Scope:
Session scope is also used in web applications. A new instance of the bean is created for each user session.
This scope is available when using the Spring Web framework.
Session-scoped beans are suitable for objects tied to the lifecycle of a user's session.

Application Scope:
Application scope is used in web applications. A single instance of the bean is created for the entire web application context.
This scope is available when using the Spring Web framework.
Application-scoped beans are suitable for objects that should be shared across all sessions and requests within the application.

# 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
