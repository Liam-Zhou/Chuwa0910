1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

seeing annotations.md
2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Springboot?

Springboot is the extension of Spring. They are the java frameworks provide IOC, MVC, … The benefits of Springboot is auto-configuration, starter.
3. What is IOC and What is DI?

IOC means Inversion of Control, the IOC container controls the creation and the deletion of the object in the application. DI means dependency injection. It’s a technique used to implement IOC.
4. What is @CompnonentScan?

It tells Spring where to look for classes marked with annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`
5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?

In your Spring XML configuration file (usually named `applicationContext.xml`), you can use the `<context:component-scan>` element to specify the base package(s) for component scanning.

In standard Spring applications, you can use the `@ComponentScan` annotation directly on your main configuration class
6. What is @SpringbootApplication?

`@SpringBootApplication` is a meta-annotation in Spring Boot that combines multiple annotations to simplify the configuration of Spring Boot applications. It is often placed on the main class of a Spring Boot application.
7. How many ways we can define a bean?

xml, `@Bean`, `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Controller`.
8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?

The default bean name is derived from the name of the annotated class or method. The default naming convention is to use the uncapitalized, non-qualified class name as the bean name.

For example, if class named `MyComponent`, the default name would be `myComponent`
9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?

Classes annotated with `@Controller` are responsible for handling frontend requests, performing request forwarding and redirection, and calling methods in the `Service` layer.

Classes annotated with `@Service` handle business logic.

Classes annotated with `@Repository` serve as Data Access Objects (DAOs), and these classes can directly operate on the database.
10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?

`@Autowired`, `@Inject`, `@value`
11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans
in Spring)? Which way is better and why?

Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, Field Injection

Constructor injection is often the preferred choice as it enforces a valid state upon object creation, makes testing easier, and improves code clarity.
12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let
the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.

using the ****`@Primary` annotation. We can also use the `@Qualifier`
13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?

BeanFactory is a more lightweight container that provides basic bean management features and initializes beans lazily. ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory and offers a richer set of features, including eager initialization of singleton beans, internationalization support, AOP features, and more.
14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.

1 singletonThis scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container (default).
2 prototypeThis scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object instances.
3 requestThis scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
4 sessionThis scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
5 global-sessionThis scopes a bean definition to a global HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we
configure the bean? 

Create an XML configuration file, typically named `applicationContext.xml`. This file will define the Spring beans and their dependencies.
