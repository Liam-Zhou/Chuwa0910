#### 1. annotations.md
    
#### 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
two key principles:
- **dependency injection**: @Autowired
- **Inversion of Control**

Spring has the ability to autowire the dependency at run time, which allows the developer
to write loosely coupled code.

**Spring** is a lightweight application framework and it provides support to various frameworks such as Struts, JSP, Hibernate, etc. and it’s used to build applications. 

**Spring Boot** is a spring-based framework that is mainly used to develop REST API’S.

The key feature of **Spring** is dependency injection and for **Spring Boot** it’s autoconfiguration.

#### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
**Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container** creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle.

**Dependency injection(DI)** is a specific implementation of IoC where dependencies are injected into the component by the IoC container.

#### 4. What is @CompnonentScan?
Use the **@ComponentScan** along with the @Configuration to specify the packages that we want to be scanned.

@SpringBootApplication is a combination of three annotations:
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan

#### 5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotation?
**xml**:

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

    <!-- Specify the package to scan for components -->
    <context:component-scan base-package="com.example.myapp" />

    <!-- Other bean definitions go here -->
    </beans>

In the example above, the <context:component-scan> element tells Spring to scan the com.example.myapp package for Spring components.

**annotations**:
1. Use the @ComponentScan on a configuration class to specify the base package for component scanning.
2. The main application class (the one annotated with @SpringBootApplication) implicitly triggers component scanning starting from the package where it's located. The class in which @SpringBootApplication is defined is used as the base package.

#### 6. What is @SpringbootApplication?
@SpringBootApplication is a combination of three annotations:

- @Configuration
- @EnableAutoConfiguration
- @ComponentScan

#### 7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
**Class level**:
- @Component
- @Service
- @Repository
- @Controller
- @ContollerAdvice

**Method level**:
@Bean (used with @Configuration) together

**XML**:

    <bean id="dataNucleusChuwaNoComponent"
    class="com.chuwa.springbasic.components.impl.Data
    NucleusChuwaNoComponent"></bean>

#### 8.What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?

**class name**

#### 9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
**@component** is a general-purpose annotation. It indicates that a class is a managed bean, and doesn't specify the role of the class.

It can be used for any class that should be managed by Spring's IoC container.

**@Service** is used to indicate that a class contains business logic or servicesand and **@repository** is used to interact with data storage. 

They are specializations of @Component, can also be used to define Spring beans.

#### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
1. **@Autowired**: By Type > By Name, could use with @Qualifier
2. **@Resource**: By Name > By Type, specifying the name of the bean
3. **@Inject**

#### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
**Constructor Injection**

    @Autowired
    public RecommenderImplementation(Filter filter) {
        this.filter = filter;
    }

**Setter Injection**

    @Autowired
    public void setFilter(Filter filter) {
        this.filter = filter;
    }

**Field Injection**

    @Autowired
    private Filter filter;

**Constructor Injection** is better. Because 
1. creates immutable objects, where the object's state does not change after it is created.
2. requires all dependencies to be explicitly declared in the constructor.
3. provides alternative implementations (e.g., using test doubles) in unit tests.
4. helps identify and resolve circular dependency issues.
5. compatible with record types.

#### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
Priority: @Qualifier > @Primary > By Name > throw exception(NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException)

1. If only one impl,directly use the impl
2. If multiple impl, use @Qualifier
3. If multiple impl, no @Qualifier, use @Primary(type level, with @Bean)
4. If multiple impl, no @Qualifier, no @Primary, by name
5. none of above, throw exception(NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException)

#### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
They are both IoC containers. **BeanFactory** loads beans on-demand, while **ApplicationContext** loads all beans at startup. 

**BeanFactory**:
- Bean instantiation/wiring

**ApplicationContext**:
- Bean instantiation/wiring
- Automatic BeanPostProcessor registration
- Automatic BeanFactoryPostProcessor registration
- Convenient MessageSource access (for i18n)
- ApplicationEvent publication

**ApplicationContext** Container is advanced than **BeanFactory** Container.

1) **BeanFactory** Container is basic container, it can only create objects and inject Dependencies. But we can not attach other services like security, transaction ,messaging etc. To provide all the services we have to use **ApplicationContext** Container.

2) **BeanFactory** Container doesn't support the feature of AutoScanning, but **ApplicationContext** Container supports.

3) **BeanFactory** Container will not create a bean object upto the request time. It means **BeanFactory** Container loads beans lazily. While **ApplicationContext** Container creates objects of Singleton bean at the time of loading only. It means there is early loading.

4) **BeanFactory** Container support only two scopes (singleton & prototype) of the beans. While **ApplicationContext** Container supports all the beans scope.

#### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
When defining a bean we have the option of declaring a scope for that bean. 

For example, to force Spring to produce a new bean instance each time one is needed, we should declare the bean's scope attribute to be prototype. 

Similarly, if we want Spring to return the same bean instance each time one is needed, we should declare the bean's scope attribute to be singleton.

Scope list:

1
**singleton**

This scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container (default).

2
**prototype**

This scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object instances.

3
**request**

This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

4
**session**

This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

5
**global-session**

This scopes a bean definition to a global HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

#### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
Use either constructor-based injection or setter-based injection to provide those parameters or dependencies.

**constructor-based injection**:

    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
        <constructor-arg type="int" value="42" />
        <constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" value="example" />
        <constructor-arg ref="anotherBean" />
    </bean>

**setter-based injection**:

    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
        <property name="someProperty" value="propertyValue" />
        <property name="anotherProperty" ref="anotherBean" />
    </bean>
