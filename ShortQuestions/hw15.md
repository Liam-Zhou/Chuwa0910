# hw15 - testing

1.  List all the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
2.  what is selenium?  
    Selenium is an automation web controller tool. It allows you to write scripts or test cases in various programming languages to interact with web browsers and perform actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, and validating web page content.
3.  what is cucumber?  
    Cucumber is an open-source tool for behavior-driven development. It provides a framework for writing executable specifications in plain text, which can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical team members
4.  what is JMeter?  
    JMeter is designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It is widely used by software testers and developers to assess the performance and scalability of web applications, web services, databases, and more.
5.  What is the lifecycle of Junit?  
    - `@BeforeAll`: class level setup, will run only once before all testing cases.
    - `@BeforeEach`: setup for each testcase, will run before each testcases.
    - `@Test`: the body of a testcase.
    - `@AfterEach`: cleanup for each testcase, will run after each testcases. 
    - `@AfterAll`: class level cleanup, will run only once after all testing cases.
6.  Is `@BeforeAll` method should be Class level(static)?  
    The method annotated `@BeforeAll` must be static, since JUnit will run it before creating instances of the test class. This will ensure the consistency across different test classes.
7.  What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?  
    Mockito allows you to create and configure mock objects for the purpose of unit testing. However, it cannot mock Final Classes and Methods, has limited support for static and private method. In these scenario, we can use PowerMock extension to mock final classes, static methods, and constructors.
8.  What is `@Mock` and what is `@InjectMocks`?  
    `@Mock` is an annotation used to create mock objects for classes or interfaces; `@InjectMocks` is used to inject mock objects (created with `@Mock`) into the class under test.
9.  What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?  
    Stubbing is the process of defining specific behaviors for mock objects. By default, a `@Mock` object will return `null` for all methods. By using stubbing, you can specify a method to return a value, throw an exception, etc.
10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?  
    ArgumentMatchers is used when stubbing. It allows you to specify criteria for method arguments, such as matching any argument of a specific type, matching specific values, or using custom matching logic.
11. what is Hamcrest Matchers?  
    Hamcrest is a framework for writing expressive and flexible matchers in unit tests. Hamcrest provides a rich set of matchers that allow you to create human-readable and customizable assertions.
12. do you know `@spy`? what is difference between `@spy` and `@Mock`?  
    `@Spy` and `@Mock` are both used to create and configure mock objects. When use `@Mock`, the mock object's methods will returns default values (e.g., null, 0, or false) and doesn't perform any real actions. You have to use stubbing to define each method you want to use. However, when using `@Spy`, it retains the original behavior of the real object for methods that are not explicitly stubbed.
13. What is assertion?  
    Assertion is used in testing, to make sure the method is doing as you want, like return certain value or throw certain exceptions. 
14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?  
    - Unit test: I will write unit test for each method for my new feature.
    - Integration test: I will write integration test to verify that the collaboration between components or modules is correct.
    - Regression test: I will re-run previously tests to ensure I didn't break any existing part.
    - Performance test: I will verify the performance and efficiency of the system.
    - Stress test: I will ensure that the system can still work normally under high pressure.  

    Most likely, I will write the code for unit test, integration test, and regression test. 
15. Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%.
16. write Integration tests for PostController. The tests should cover all scenarios
