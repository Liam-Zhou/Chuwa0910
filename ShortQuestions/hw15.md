## 2.  Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies
![Microservice Architecture](images/hw15/Microservice%20Architecture%20%20.png)

Here's an overview of the key components and the flow in a microservices architecture:

1. **Microservices**: Microservices are the individual components or services that make up the application. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business capability or feature. Microservices are typically developed using different technologies and can have their own databases, which is known as polyglot persistence.

2. **API Gateway**: An API gateway is a central entry point for external clients to interact with the microservices. It handles routing client requests to the appropriate microservices and can provide features like load balancing, authentication, and rate limiting.

3. **Service Discovery- Service Registry(`Eureka`)**: Microservices need to find and communicate with each other. Service discovery is a mechanism that allows microservices to locate and communicate with one another dynamically. Tools like Eureka, Consul, or Kubernetes service discovery can be used.

4. **Load Balancing(`Ribbon/Nginx`)**: Load balancing is essential to distribute incoming client requests across multiple instances of a microservice, ensuring high availability and optimal resource utilization.

5. **Authentication and Authorization**: Security is a crucial concern in microservices architecture. Each microservice should authenticate and authorize incoming requests to ensure that only authorized clients can access specific services.

6. **Communication Protocols(`Kafka`)**: Microservices often communicate with each other using lightweight protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, gRPC, or message queues such as RabbitMQ or Kafka.

7. **Data Storage**: Each microservice can have its own data store, which can be a relational database, NoSQL database, or other data storage solutions. Data storage choices are made based on the specific needs of the microservice.

8. **Monitoring and Logging(`resilience4J/Hystrix`)**: Monitoring and logging are essential for tracking the health and performance of microservices. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, or centralized logging systems are used to collect and analyze data.

9. **Containerization(`Docker`)**: Many microservices are deployed as containers using technologies like Docker. Containerization provides a consistent environment for development and production.

10. **Orchestration(`Kubernetes`)**: Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are often used to manage and deploy microservices. They offer features for scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance.

11. **Scaling**: Microservices can be independently scaled based on their specific usage patterns. This allows optimizing resource allocation for each service.

Flow in a Microservices Architecture:
1. An external client sends a request to the API Gateway.
2. The API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate microservice based on the URL or other criteria.
3. The microservice processes the request and communicates with other microservices if necessary.
4. If data is required, the microservice may interact with its own data store or other data services.
5. After processing, the microservice sends a response to the client through the API Gateway.
6. If needed, the microservice may publish events or messages to message queues for other microservices to consume.
7. Monitoring and logging capture relevant data for analysis and troubleshooting.




## 3.  What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
### What are Resilience patterns? 
Resilience patterns are <u>a set of practices and strategies</u> that <u>are designed to ensure that a system can continue to operate and provide a certain level of service, even in the presence of failures or unexpected issues.</u>

Resilience patterns
- Time out
    - A timeout prevents a microservice from waiting too long for another microservice.
- Circuit breaker
    - If a system call results in an error, the circuit breaker is opened and does not allow any calls to pass through
- Retry
    - Automatically retrying an operation that has failed, which can be helpful for transient failures.
- Bulkhead
    - Isolating and limiting the impact of failures in one part of a system on other parts.
- Fallback
    - Providing a backup or default response or behavior when a primary service fails.

### What is circuit breaker?
If a system call results in an error, the circuit breaker is opened and temporarily does not allow any calls to pass through to the failing service or component.
- The circuit breaker can be in one of three states: `Closed` (normal operation), `Open` (preventing interactions), or `Half-Open` (testing to see if the service has recovered).

![Circuit breaker](images/hw15/Circuit%20breaker.png)

For resilience, a library like `Hystrix`(no longer actively by Netflix)/`Resilience4j`(modern and actively maintained) can be useful.

Hystrix is a library developed by Netflix that implements the circuit breaker pattern Spring Cloud offers an integration and further simplification for Hystrix.

Why using Hystrix:
When one service calls another, but the another service has a problem, Hystrix can catch all problems of underlying services and process a fallback plan.

### 6. Write difference between Monolithic, SOA and Microservices Architecture.
![Monolithic, SOA and Microservices Architecture](images/hw15/Monolithic%2C%20SOA%20and%20Microservices%20Architecture.png)
- Monolithic(整体的) Architecture: It is "like a big container" where all the software components of an application are bundled together tightly.  It is usually built as one large system and is one code-base. 
- SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture): It is a group of services interacting or communicating with each other. Depending on the nature of the communication, it can be simple data exchange or it could involve several services coordinating some activity.   
- Microservice Architecture: It involves structuring an application in the form of a cluster of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain. The functional modules can be deployed independently, are scalable, are aimed at achieving specific business goals, and communicate with each other over standard protocols. 

### 7. Explain spring cloud and spring boot.

Spring Cloud: In Microservices, the Spring cloud is a system that integrates with external systems. This is a short-lived framework designed to build applications quickly. It contributes significantly to microservice architecture due to its association with finite amounts of data processing. Some of the features of spring cloud are shown below:
![spring cloud](images/hw15/spring%20cloud.png)

Spring Boot: Spring Boot is an open-sourced, Java-based framework that provides its developers with a platform on which they can create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. In addition to reducing development time and increasing productivity, it is easily understood.  
![Spring Boot](images/hw15/Spring%20Boot.png)

### 8. What is the role of actuator in spring boot?

A spring boot actuator is a project that provides restful web services to access the current state of an application that is running in production. In addition, you can monitor and manage application usage in a production environment without having to code or configure any of the applications.

### 9. Explain how you can override the default properties of Spring boot projects.

By specifying properties in the application.properties file, it is possible to override the default properties of a spring boot project.  

Example: 
In Spring MVC applications, you need to specify a suffix and prefix. You can do this by adding the properties listed below in the application.properties file. 

For suffix – spring.mvc.view.suffix: .jsp 
For prefix – spring.mvc.view.prefix: /WEB-INF/ 

### 10. What issues are generally solved by spring clouds?

The following problems can be solved with spring cloud:   

- Complicated issues caused by distributed systems: This includes network issues, latency problems, bandwidth problems, and security issues. 
- Service Discovery issues: Service discovery allows processes and services to communicate and locate each other within a cluster. 
- Redundancy issues: Distributed systems can often have redundancy issues. 
- Load balancing issues: Optimize the distribution of workloads among multiple computing resources, including computer clusters, central processing units, and network links. 
- Reduces performance issues: Reduces performance issues caused by various operational overheads. 

### 11. What do you mean by Cohesion and Coupling?

Coupling: It is defined as a relationship between software modules A and B, and how much one module depends or interacts with another one. Couplings fall into three major categories. Modules can be highly coupled (highly dependent), loosely coupled, and uncoupled from each other. The best kind of coupling is loose coupling, which is achieved through interfaces. 

Cohesion: It is defined as a relationship between two or more parts/elements of a module that serves the same purpose. Generally, a module with high cohesion can perform a specific function efficiently without needing communication with any other modules. High cohesion enhances the functionality of the module.

![Cohesion and Coupling](images/hw15/Cohesion%20and%20Coupling.png)

### 12. What do you mean by Bounded Context?

A Bounded Context is a central pattern in DDD (Domain-Driven Design), which deals with collaboration across large models and teams. DDD breaks large models down into multiple contexts to make them more manageable. Additionally, it explains their relationship explicitly. The concept promotes an object-oriented approach to developing services bound to a data model and is also responsible for ensuring the integrity and mutability of said data model. 

![Bounded Context](images/hw15/Bounded%20Context.png)


### 13. Write the fundamental characteristics of Microservice Design.

- Based on Business Capabilities: Services are divided and organized around business capabilities. 
- Products not projects: A product should belong to the team that handles it.  
- Essential messaging frameworks: Rely on functional messaging frameworks: Eliminate centralized service buses by embracing the concept of decentralization.  
- Decentralized Governance: The development teams are accountable for all aspects of the software they produce.  
- Decentralized data management: Microservices allow each service to manage its data separately.  
- Automated infrastructure: These systems are complete and can be deployed independently.   
- Design for failure: Increase the tolerance for failure of services by focusing on continuous monitoring of the applications. 

### 14. What are the challenges that one has to face while using Microservices?

The challenges that one has to face while using microservices can be both functional and technical as given below: 

- Functional Challenges:
    - Require heavy infrastructure setup. 
    - Need Heavy investment. 
    - Require excessive planning to handle or manage operations overhead.

- Technical Challenges:
    - Microservices are always interdependent. Therefore, they must communicate with each other.   
    - It is a heavily involved model because it is a distributed system.   
    - You need to be prepared for operations overhead if you are using Microservice architecture.   
    - To support heterogeneously distributed microservices, you need skilled professionals.    
    - It is difficult to automate because of the number of smaller components. For that reason, each component must be built, deployed, and monitored separately.   
    - It is difficult to manage configurations across different environments for all components. 
    - Challenges associated with deployment, debugging, and testing. 

### 15. Explain PACT in microservices.

PACT is defined as an open-source tool that allows service providers and consumers to test interactions in isolation against contracts that have been made to increase the reliability of microservice integration. It also offers support for numerous languages, such as Ruby, Java, Scala, .NET, JavaScript, Swift/Objective-C. 

### 16. Explain how independent microservices communicate with each other.

Communication between microservices can take place through: 

- HTTP/REST with JSON or binary protocol for request-response 
- Websockets for streaming.  
- A broker or server program that uses advanced routing algorithms.  

RabbitMQ, Nats, Kafka, etc., can be used as message brokers; each is built to handle a particular message semantic. You can also use Backend as a Service like Space Cloud to automate your entire backend. 

### 17. What do you mean by client certificates?

The client certificate is a type of digital certificate that generally allows client systems to authenticate their requests to remote servers. In many mutual authentication designs, it plays a key role in providing strong assurance of the requestor's identity.

### 18. Explain CDC.

As the name implies, CDC (Consumer-Driven Contract) basically ensures service communication compatibility by establishing an agreement between consumers and service providers regarding the format of the data exchanged between them. An agreement like this is called a contract. Basically, it is a pattern used to develop Microservices so that they can be efficiently used by external systems.

### 19. Name some famous companies that use Microservice architecture.

Microservices architecture has replaced monolithic architecture for most large-scale websites like: 

Twitter 
Netflix 
Amazon, etc.

### 20. What do you mean by Domain driven design?

DDD (Domain-Driven-Design) is basically an architectural style that is based on Object-Oriented Analysis Design approaches and principles. In this approach, the business domain is modeled carefully in software, without regard to how the system actually works. By interconnecting related components of the software system into a continuously evolving system, it facilitates the development of complex systems. There are three fundamental principles underlying it as shown below: 

- Concentrate on the core domain and domain logic. 
- Analyze domain models to find complex designs. 
- Engage in regular collaboration with the domain experts to improve the application model and address emerging domain issues. 

### 21. Explain OAuth.

Generally speaking, OAuth (Open Authorization Protocol) enables users to authenticate themselves with third-party service providers. With this protocol, you can access client applications on HTTP for third-party providers such as GitHub, Facebook, etc. Using it, you can also share resources on one site with another site without requiring their credentials.

### 22. Explain the term Eureka in Microservices.

Eureka Server, also referred to as Netflix Service Discovery Server, is an application that keeps track of all client-service applications. As every Microservice registers to Eureka Server, Eureka Server knows all the client applications running on the different ports and IP addresses. It generally uses Spring Cloud and is not heavy on the application development process. 




## 5.  how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
- a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview-question/
- b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions

1. **Application Layer Load Balancing:**
   - **HTTP/HTTPS Load Balancers:** These load balancers operate at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model and distribute HTTP/HTTPS requests based on various criteria like URL paths, headers, cookies, or session information. Technologies like NGINX, HAProxy, or cloud-based solutions such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) provide sophisticated application-layer load balancing capabilities.

2. **Transport Layer Load Balancing:**
   - **TCP/UDP Load Balancers:** Working at the transport layer (Layer 4), these load balancers route traffic based on network information like IP addresses and ports. They distribute incoming requests across multiple service instances without inspecting the content of the traffic. Technologies like software-based IPVS or hardware load balancers perform transport layer load balancing.

3. **DNS-Based Load Balancing:**
   - **DNS Round-Robin:** DNS servers can distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers by rotating the IP addresses returned for a specific domain name. However, it lacks intelligence to consider server health or load conditions.
   - **DNS with Health Checks:** Advanced DNS-based solutions perform health checks on backend servers and provide intelligent load distribution based on the server's health status.

4. **Load Balancing Algorithms:**
   - **Round Robin:** Distributes traffic evenly across backend servers in a cyclic manner.
   - **Least Connections:** Routes requests to the server with the fewest active connections, aiming to distribute the load evenly.
   - **Weighted Round Robin:** Assigns different weights to servers based on their capacity, allowing higher-capacity servers to handle more traffic.
   - **Least Response Time:** Routes traffic to the server with the lowest response time or latency, optimizing performance.
   - **Adaptive Load Balancing:** Dynamically adjusts load distribution based on real-time server health and performance metrics.

5. **Microservices-Specific Considerations:**
   - **Service Discovery:** Load balancing in microservices heavily relies on service discovery mechanisms like Netflix Eureka, Consul, or Kubernetes Service Discovery to dynamically register and locate services.
   - **Dynamic Configuration:** Load balancers should support dynamic configuration updates to adapt to changing service instances' availability and health.
   - **Circuit Breakers and Health Checks:** Implementing circuit breakers and health checks within load balancers can prevent routing traffic to unhealthy or failing service instances, ensuring high availability and reliability.




## 6.  How to do service discovery?
Service discovery is a crucial aspect of building scalable and dynamic distributed systems, especially in microservices architectures. It involves the automatic detection and registration of services within an infrastructure, allowing services to locate and communicate with each other. Here are some common approaches to implement service discovery:

1. **Replication with Load Balancers::**
   - **How it works:** Replication involves creating and maintaining multiple copies (replicas) of the same service or data across multiple nodes in a distributed system. Load balancers are combined with service discovery to distribute traffic among available services.
   - **Examples:** `NGINX`, HAProxy, and cloud-based load balancers.
   - **Advantages:** Scalability, load balancing capabilities.
   - **Considerations:** Complexity in managing load balancers, potential performance bottlenecks.

2. **Service Registry:** 服务注册表
   - **How it works:** Service registries are centralized databases that keep track of the locations and statuses of service instances. When a service instance starts or stops, it registers or deregisters itself with the registry.  通过一个中心的service registry，也是有一个id
   - **Examples:** Netflix `Eureka`, Consul, etcd.
   - **Advantages:** Centralized control, dynamic updates, additional features like health checks.
   - **Considerations:** Introduces a single point of failure (the registry).
   - Service Registries 是集中化的组件，负责存储和管理服务的位置信息

3. **DNS-Based Service Discovery:**
   - **How it works:**  DNS-Based Service Discovery relies on the Domain Name System to resolve service names to their corresponding IP addresses. Each service instance registers its IP address and port with a DNS server.  通过在dns上进行registers，每个service都有corresponding IP addresses
   - **Advantages:** Simplicity, compatibility with existing DNS infrastructure.
   - **Considerations:** Limited support for dynamic updates in traditional DNS.

4. **Self-Registration:** 自注册 
   - **How it works:** Services independently register themselves with a discovery mechanism.
   - **Advantages:** Decentralized, no single point of failure.
   - **Considerations:** Requires services to be aware of the registration process, may need a mechanism for service heartbeats.
   - 去中心化，每个服务实例自行管理自己的注册。




## 7. What are the major components of Kafka?

1. **Producer:** 
   - The Producer is responsible for publishing (producing) data or records into Kafka topics. It writes messages to Kafka topics and is generally unaware of the consumers or how the data will be consumed.

2. **Consumer:** 
   - The Consumer reads data from Kafka topics. Multiple consumers can subscribe to a topic, and Kafka ensures that each message in a partition is delivered to only one consumer within a consumer group, allowing parallel processing of messages.

3. **Broker:** 
   - Brokers are the Kafka servers responsible for storing and managing the Kafka topics, i.e., they manage the ingestion, storage, and retrieval of messages. Kafka clusters consist of multiple brokers to provide fault tolerance and scalability.

4. **Topic:** 
   - A Topic is a category or stream name to which records are published by Producers. Each topic is split into partitions, and each partition is replicated across multiple brokers for fault tolerance.

5. **Partition:** 
   - Topics are divided into multiple partitions for scalability and parallelism. Each partition is an ordered and immutable sequence of records. Partitions allow messages to be distributed across different brokers and processed in parallel.

6. **Offset:** 
   - Each message within a partition has a unique sequential ID called an offset. Offsets represent the position of a message within a partition and are used by consumers to keep track of the messages they have already consumed.

7. **Consumer Groups:** 
   - Consumers that belong to the same consumer group consume messages from different partitions of the same topic. Each consumer within a group reads from a unique subset of partitions, enabling parallel processing and load balancing.

8. **ZooKeeper (previously a major component, but now deprecated in newer Kafka versions):** 
   - ZooKeeper used to manage and coordinate Kafka brokers, topics, and partitions. However, in newer Kafka versions (2.8.0 and above), ZooKeeper dependency is being replaced by an internal metadata management mechanism called the Kafka Controller.




## 8.  What do you mean by a Partition in Kafka?
Topics are divided into multiple partitions for scalability and parallelism. Each partition is an ordered and immutable sequence of records. Partitions allow messages to be distributed across different brokers and processed in parallel.




## 9.  What do you mean by zookeeper in Kafka and what are its uses?
ZooKeeper used to manage and coordinate Kafka brokers, topics, and partitions. However, in newer Kafka versions (2.8.0 and above), ZooKeeper dependency is being replaced by an internal metadata management mechanism called the Kafka Controller.




## 10. Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper?
In earlier versions of Apache Kafka, ZooKeeper was an essential dependency and integral part of the Kafka ecosystem. However, recent versions of Kafka (from 2.8.0 onwards) are introducing KIP-500 (Kafka Improvement Proposal) to remove the dependency on ZooKeeper for Kafka's metadata storage.

In newer versions of Kafka (2.8.0 and above), the ZooKeeper dependency for Kafka metadata is being replaced by the Kafka Controller, which handles metadata, configurations, and coordination internally without requiring an external dependency like ZooKeeper.




## 11. Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka.
the Leader is responsible for handling all read and write operations for its partition, while the Followers replicate the Leader's log and act as backups, ensuring fault tolerance and high availability in the Kafka cluster. This architecture allows Kafka to maintain data integrity, scalability, and resilience in handling streams of messages across distributed systems.

**Leader:**
   - For each partition, one broker is designated as the "Leader" and is responsible for handling all read and write requests for that partition.
   - The Leader receives all the write requests (produced messages) for its partition from Producers and stores them in its partition log.
   - It also serves read requests (consumed messages) from Consumers, replicating messages to the Followers as needed.
   - The Leader maintains the in-sync replicas and keeps track of the followers' progress in replicating messages.

**Follower:**
   - Each partition's Leader replicates messages to one or more "Follower" replicas, which are copies of the Leader's partition log.
   - Followers replicate the messages from the Leader and maintain the same sequence of messages as the Leader's log.
   - Follower replicas are passive and don't serve client requests directly. They sync with the Leader to stay up-to-date.




## 12. Why is Topic Replication important in Kafka? What do you mean by ISR in Kafka?

1. **Fault Tolerance:** 
   - Replication ensures that if a Kafka broker fails or becomes unavailable, another broker with a replica of the partition can take over without data loss or service interruption. This resilience helps in maintaining data availability and system stability.

2. **High Availability:** 
   - Having replicas spread across multiple brokers allows Kafka to continue serving read and write requests even if some brokers are down. This redundancy ensures that there are always available replicas for clients to consume data.

3. **Durability:** 
   - Replication provides durability by keeping multiple copies of data. In case of hardware failures or data corruption, Kafka can recover data from healthy replicas, ensuring that messages are not lost.

4. **Scalability:** 
   - Replicated partitions can be distributed across different brokers, enabling Kafka to handle high throughput and scale horizontally by adding more brokers without compromising data availability.

5. **Consistency and Redundancy:** 
   - Kafka ensures that all replicas of a partition are consistent. By maintaining an In-Sync Replica (ISR) set, Kafka guarantees that all replicas are up-to-date with the leader, ensuring data consistency across replicas.

ISR (In-Sync Replica):
- **ISR (In-Sync Replica):** 
   - In Kafka, ISR refers to the set of replicas for a partition that are considered in sync with the Leader. The ISR includes replicas that are caught up with the Leader's log and can provide acknowledgments (acks) for written messages.
   - Kafka dynamically manages the ISR based on the availability and performance of replicas. If a replica falls behind the Leader's log or becomes unavailable, it may be removed from the ISR until it catches up or becomes healthy again.
   - ISR ensures that only replicas capable of keeping up with the Leader's log are considered for data replication, maintaining data consistency and reliability across the Kafka cluster.




## 13. What do you understand about a consumer group in Kafka?
In Apache Kafka, a consumer group is a logical grouping of consumers that jointly consume and process messages from one or more topics within a Kafka cluster. 

Consumer groups facilitate scalable and parallel consumption of messages from Kafka topics, providing fault tolerance and load distribution.




## 14. How do you start a Kafka server?
including setting up the Kafka environment and running the necessary commands. 

To start a Kafka server on a Mac, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Download Apache Kafka:**
   - First, download the Apache Kafka binaries from the official Apache Kafka website: [Apache Kafka Downloads](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).
   - Choose the desired Kafka version and download the binary package (e.g., `.tgz` file).

2. **Extract the Kafka Archive:**
   - Once downloaded, extract the Kafka archive to a location on your Mac where you want Kafka to be installed.
   - For example, you can extract it using Terminal with the following command:
     ```
     tar -xzf kafka_2.x-x.x.x.tgz
     ```

3. **Navigate to Kafka Directory:**
   - Open Terminal and navigate to the Kafka directory that was extracted.
   - Use the `cd` command to change directories:
     ```
     cd path/to/kafka-directory
     ```

4. **Start ZooKeeper (if not using the internal Kafka Controller):**
   - If you're using an older version of Kafka (2.7.x or earlier) that relies on ZooKeeper, start ZooKeeper first.
   - Execute the ZooKeeper server (if applicable) by running the following command in a new Terminal window/tab or by using a separate terminal window:
     ```
     bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
     ```

5. **Start Kafka Server:**
   - Start the Kafka server by executing the Kafka server script. Use the following command in the Kafka directory:
     ```
     bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
     ```
   - This command starts the Kafka broker and uses the default `server.properties` configuration file. You can modify the configurations in this file based on your requirements.

6. **Verify Kafka Server Startup:**
   - After executing the above command, Kafka will start running on your local machine.
   - Verify that Kafka has started successfully by checking the logs in the Terminal window where you initiated the server.

7. **Create Topics and Interact with Kafka:**
   - With Kafka running, you can create topics, produce messages, and consume messages using the Kafka command line tools (`kafka-topics.sh`, `kafka-console-producer.sh`, `kafka-console-consumer.sh`).




## 15. Tell me about some of the real-world usages of Apache Kafka.

8. **Telecommunications:**
   - **Network Monitoring:** Kafka is used for real-time monitoring and analysis of network data, handling large volumes of network logs, call data records (CDRs), and event data.




## 16. Describe partitioning key in Kafka.
- Kafka topics are divided into multiple partitions to allow for parallelism and scalability. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages.
- Messages within a partition are ordered based on their offsets and remain in the order they were produced.

the partitioning key in Kafka allows producers to control how messages are distributed among partitions within a topic. It helps in achieving ordering, grouping related data, and evenly distributing the message load across partitions, optimizing Kafka's performance and scalability.




## 17.  What is the purpose of partitions in Kafka?
partitions in Kafka are fundamental components that enable scalability, fault tolerance, ordering, and parallelism within topics. They play a crucial role in facilitating high-throughput, real-time data processing, and fault-tolerant distributed messaging in Kafka clusters.


## 18. Differentiate between Rabbitmq and Kafka.
RabbitMQ is a traditional message broker focusing on queuing and routing messages, while Kafka is a distributed streaming platform optimized for high-throughput, real-time event streaming, and data processing. 




## 19. What are the guarantees that Kafka provides?
Apache Kafka provides several key guarantees to ensure reliable and consistent message processing within its distributed streaming platform. The guarantees provided by Kafka include:

1. **Message Persistence:**
   - Kafka ensures durable storage of messages by persisting them to disk in a distributed commit log.
   - Guarantee: Messages are stored for a configurable retention period, preventing data loss even in the case of consumer failures.

2. **At-Least-Once Delivery:**
   - Kafka guarantees that messages are delivered to consumers at least once.
   - Guarantee: In case of failure or retries, messages may be delivered multiple times but never lost.

3. **Message Ordering within Partitions:**
   - Kafka ensures strict message ordering within a partition.
   - Guarantee: Messages within the same partition are processed in the order they are produced, allowing sequential processing and maintaining data integrity.

4. **Partition Replication and Fault Tolerance:**
   - Kafka replicates partitions across multiple brokers for fault tolerance.
   - Guarantee: If a broker fails or becomes unavailable, Kafka automatically promotes a replica as a leader to ensure uninterrupted service and data availability without loss.

5. **Scalability and Parallelism:**
   - Kafka allows parallel processing by distributing messages across partitions.
   - Guarantee: Multiple consumers within a consumer group can process messages from different partitions concurrently, enabling scalability without compromising data integrity.

6. **Consumer Offsets:**
   - Kafka maintains consumer offsets to track the last read position for each consumer in a consumer group.
   - Guarantee: If a consumer restarts or joins a group, Kafka ensures that the consumer resumes reading from the correct offset, preventing message reprocessing or loss.

7. **Exactly-Once Semantics (Transactional Support):**
   - Kafka provides end-to-end exactly-once message processing for applications that use Kafka's transactional API.
   - Guarantee: This feature ensures both producer and consumer transactions are atomic, meaning messages are processed exactly once even in the face of failures.

8. **Consistent and Configurable Retention Policies:**
   - Kafka allows setting retention policies at the topic level to control how long messages are retained.
   - Guarantee: Configurable retention policies ensure messages are retained for the required duration, allowing for reliable message access within that timeframe.




## 20. What do you mean by an unbalanced cluster in Kafka? How can you balance it?
An unbalanced cluster in Apache Kafka refers to a situation where the distribution of data, partitions, or workload across the brokers in the Kafka cluster is uneven. This imbalance can occur due to various reasons such as uneven partition assignment, uneven data distribution, or uneven consumer load among the brokers.

Monitoring the cluster's health, workload distribution, and resource utilization is crucial to identify any imbalances and take appropriate corrective actions. Balancing a Kafka cluster involves redistributing partitions, adjusting topic configurations, adding or removing brokers, and ensuring uniform consumer load across partitions to achieve an evenly distributed workload and maintain cluster stability.




## 21. In your recent project, are you a producer or consumer or both?
both. I produce events related to customer purchases and preferences while also consuming data for analytics and personalized recommendations.




## 22. In your recent project, Could you tell me your topic name?
mall_transactions



## 23. In your recent project, How many brokers do you have? How many partitions for each topic? How many data for each topic.
- Number of Brokers: The Kafka cluster might consist of 3 brokers to handle the incoming stream of data efficiently.
- Partitions for the Topic: To handle the load, the "mall_transactions" topic might be set up with 10 partitions to allow for parallel processing and scalability.
- Volume of Data: Considering the volume of data, let's assume that each partition stores approximately 1 million records per day. So, with 10 partitions, it would accumulate around 10 million records daily.




## 24. In your recent project, which team produce what kind of event to you and you producer what kind of events?
- Producing Teams and Event Types: Various teams in the mall contribute to event production:
Sales Team: Produces purchase events like "item purchased," "payment made," "receipt generated."
Customer Service Team: Produces events related to customer feedback, such as "customer satisfaction survey submitted," "complaint registered."
- Marketing Team: Generates events related to promotional activities like "coupon redeemed," "discount applied."
Inventory Management Team: Produces events like "stock replenished," "item restocked."
AI Assistant (Producer) Events: As an AI assistant acting as a producer:
I generate events related to customer behavior such as "customer browsing behavior," "product interest shown," "recommended items based on purchase history."
I might also produce events related to system health and performance, like "Kafka cluster status update," "analytics dashboard update."




## 25. What is offset?
an offset is a unique identifier or a sequential number assigned to each message within a partition. It represents the position of a consumer within a partition's message log. Offsets are managed and maintained by Kafka to track the progress of consumers in reading messages from a topic's partitions.
