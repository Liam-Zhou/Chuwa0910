### Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies

Microservice architecture is a style of software development in which complex software applications are composed of small, independent services. Each service is responsible for a single well-defined task, and services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs.

Microservice architecture offers a number of benefits, including:

* Scalability: Microservices can be scaled independently, making it easier to scale the overall application.
* Resilience: Microservices are more resilient to failures than monolithic applications. If one microservice fails, the other microservices can continue to operate.
* Agility: Microservices can be developed, deployed, and updated independently, making it easier to make changes to the application.

Components/Tools/Dependencies

There are a number of different components and tools that can be used to build and deploy microservice architectures. Some of the most popular include:

* Container orchestration platforms: Container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, make it easy to deploy and manage microservices.
* Service discovery: Service discovery mechanisms, such as Consul and Eureka, allow microservices to find and communicate with each other.
* API gateways: API gateways provide a single entry point for clients to access microservices.
Messaging systems: Messaging systems, such as RabbitMQ and Kafka, allow microservices to communicate with each other asynchronously.

### What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?  

Resilience patterns are a set of design patterns that can be used to make software applications more resilient to failures. Some of the most common resilience patterns include:

* Retry: The retry pattern attempts to execute an operation multiple times if it fails. This can be useful for dealing with transient errors, such as network timeouts.
* Fallback: The fallback pattern provides a fallback alternative if an operation fails. This can be useful for preventing the overall application from failing if one service is unavailable.
* Timeout: The timeout pattern specifies a maximum amount of time that an operation is allowed to run. This can be useful for preventing long-running operations from blocking other operations.
* Circuit breaker: The circuit breaker pattern prevents an application from making requests to a service that is likely to fail. This can be useful for preventing cascading failures.
Circuit Breaker

The circuit breaker pattern is a state machine that has three states:

* Closed: The circuit breaker is closed and requests are allowed to flow to the service.
* Open: The circuit breaker is open and all requests are rejected.
* Half-open: The circuit breaker is half-open and a single request is allowed to flow to the service.

### How to do service discovery?

There are a number of different ways to do service discovery in a microservice architecture. One common approach is to use a service registry. A service registry is a database that contains information about all of the services in the application. Clients can query the service registry to find the location of the services they need to communicate with.

Another approach to service discovery is to use a distributed hash table (DHT). A DHT is a distributed data structure that can be used to store and retrieve key-value pairs. Clients can use a DHT to store the location of the services they need to communicate with.

### What are the major components of Kafka?

The major components of Kafka are:

* Producers: Producers are responsible for sending data to Kafka.
* Consumers: Consumers are responsible for reading data from Kafka.
* Brokers: Brokers are responsible for storing and managing Kafka topics.
* Zookeeper: Zookeeper is a distributed coordination service that Kafka uses to manage the cluster.

### What do you mean by a Partition in Kafka?

A partition is a logical division of a Kafka topic. Each partition is an ordered sequence of messages. Partitions are distributed across the brokers in the Kafka cluster. This allows Kafka to scale horizontally by adding more brokers.

### What do you mean by zookeeper in Kafka and what are its uses?

Zookeeper is a distributed coordination service that Kafka uses to manage the cluster. Zookeeper is responsible for maintaining the state of the cluster, such as the list of brokers and the leaders of each partition.

### Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper?

No, Kafka cannot be used without Zookeeper. Zookeeper is essential for Kafka to manage the cluster and maintain state.

### Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka.

Each partition in Kafka has a leader and one or more followers. The leader is responsible for replicating the partition to the followers and handling read and write requests. The followers replicate the partition from the leader and are ready to take over as leader if the leader fails.

### Why is Topic Replication important in Kafka? What do you mean by ISR in Kafka?

Topic replication is important in Kafka because it provides high availability and durability. If a broker fails, the followers can continue to serve the partition.

The in-sync replica (ISR) is a set of replicas that are in sync with the leader. The leader only replicates data to the ISR. This ensures that the replicas are always up to date and can take over as leader if the leader fails.

### What do you understand about a consumer group in Kafka?

A consumer group is a set of consumers that are coordinated to consume messages from a topic. Each consumer group maintains a separate offset for each partition. This allows consumers to consume messages from a topic in parallel without overlapping.

### How do you start a Kafka server?

To start a Kafka server, you need to run the following command:

```kafka-server-start server.properties```

The ```server.properties``` file contains the configuration for the Kafka server.

### Tell me about some of the real-world usages of Apache Kafka.

Apache Kafka is used in a variety of real-world applications, including:

* Streaming analytics: Kafka can be used to build real-time streaming analytics pipelines.
* Microservices communication: Kafka can be used to implement microservices communication and orchestration.
* Log aggregation: Kafka can be used to aggregate logs from distributed systems.
* Event-driven applications: Kafka can be used to build event-driven applications.
  
### Describe partitioning key in Kafka.

The partitioning key is a key that is used to determine which partition a message is sent to. Kafka uses a hash function to map the partitioning key to a partition. This ensures that messages with the same partitioning key are always sent to the same partition.

### What is the purpose of partitions in Kafka?

Partitions are used to scale Kafka horizontally and to improve performance. By partitioning topics, Kafka can distribute the load across multiple brokers. This allows Kafka to handle a high volume of messages.

### Differentiate between RabbitMQ and Kafka.

RabbitMQ and Kafka are both messaging systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.

RabbitMQ

* Message broker: RabbitMQ is a message broker, which means that it provides a variety of messaging features, such as exchanges, queues, and bindings.
* Flexible: RabbitMQ is very flexible and can be used for a variety of different use cases, such as task queues, publish/subscribe, and request/response.
* Complex: RabbitMQ can be complex to set up and manage, especially for large and complex applications.
Kafka

* Distributed streaming platform: Kafka is a distributed streaming platform, which means that it is designed to handle high volumes of data in real time.
* Scalable: Kafka is highly scalable and can be used to process millions of messages per second.
* Durable: Kafka is very durable and can withstand failures of individual brokers.
* Simpler: Kafka is simpler to set up and manage than RabbitMQ, especially for large and complex applications.

### What are the guarantees that Kafka provides?

Kafka provides the following guarantees:

At-least-once delivery: Kafka guarantees that messages will be delivered to consumers at least once.
Durability: Kafka guarantees that messages will be persisted to disk and will not be lost, even if a broker fails.
Ordered delivery: Kafka guarantees that messages will be delivered to consumers in the order they were produced.
Kafka also supports exactly-once delivery, but this requires enabling transactional producers and consumers.

### What do you mean by an unbalanced cluster in Kafka? How can you balance it?

An unbalanced cluster in Kafka is a cluster where the partitions are not evenly distributed across the brokers. This can lead to some brokers being overloaded, while others are underutilized.

To balance a Kafka cluster, you can use the following methods:

Rebalance the partitions: You can use the Kafka rebalance tool to rebalance the partitions across the brokers.
Add more brokers: If the cluster is underpowered, you can add more brokers to the cluster. This will distribute the load more evenly.
Reduce the replication factor: You can reduce the replication factor for the topics. This will reduce the number of copies of each message that are stored on the brokers.

### What is offset

An offset in Kafka is a unique identifier for a message within a partition. Each message in a partition has a unique offset, which is a monotonically increasing integer. Offsets are used by Kafka to track the progress of consumers and to ensure that messages are delivered to consumers in the correct order.

Consumers use offsets to keep track of where they are in a partition. When a consumer starts consuming messages from a partition, it begins at the beginning of the partition, with offset 0. As the consumer consumes messages, it increments its offset. When the consumer reaches the end of the partition, it can either stop consuming messages or start consuming messages from the beginning of the partition again.

Offsets are also used by Kafka to ensure that messages are delivered to consumers in the correct order. When a producer produces a message to a partition, Kafka assigns the message an offset. The offset is then used to determine the order in which the message is delivered to consumers.
