1. List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
2. what is selenium?
> Selenium is an open-source automation testing tool used for automating web applications for testing purposes. It provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without needing to learn a test scripting language.

3. what is cucumber?
> Cucumber is a testing framework that supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). It uses the Gherkin language to write test cases in a plain text format that is easily understandable by non-technical stakeholders.

4. what is JMeter?
> Apache JMeter is an open-source Java-based performance testing tool. It's used to test the performance of both static and dynamic resources, simulate heavy loads on servers, networks, objects, and more.

5. What is the life circle of Junit?
> The lifecycle of JUnit involves specific annotations that dictate the sequence of method execution during testing. For example, @BeforeAll and @AfterAll are class-level setup and teardown methods, while @BeforeEach and @AfterEach run before and after each test method.

6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
> In JUnit 5, the @BeforeAll method is used for setup tasks before all the tests in a test class. It should be static as it operates at the class level.

7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?
> Mockito is a popular Java framework used for creating and working with mock objects during testing. Its limitations include difficulty in mocking static or final methods, constructors, or enums. Tools like PowerMockito can overcome some of these limitations.

8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
> @Mock is used to create a mock object, while @InjectMocks injects those mock objects into the class being tested.

9. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
> Stubbing is defining specific behaviors for mock objects. It's telling a mock what to return when certain methods are called during testing.

10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
> Mockito ArgumentMatchers are used to match arguments in mock method calls and stubbing. They allow flexible verification and stubbing.

11. what is Hamcrest Matchers
> Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. It's often used in conjunction with testing frameworks like JUnit.

12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
> @Spy is used to create a partial mock where the actual methods of the object are invoked unless stubbed. @Mock creates a completely mocked object where the actual methods are not invoked.

13. What is assertion?
> An assertion in testing is a statement that verifies the expected results of a test. It validates whether a certain condition is true and halts the test if it's false.

14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature?
    and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of
    tests?
> Different types of tests include Unit tests (to test individual units of code), Integration tests (to test how different units work together), and Functional tests (to test the functionality from the user's perspective). Each type serves a different purpose: unit tests verify specific parts of the code, integration tests ensure those parts work together, and functional tests validate the entire feature's functionality.

15. Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%.
> see code in test part
16. Write Integration tests for PostController. The tests should cover all scenarios.
