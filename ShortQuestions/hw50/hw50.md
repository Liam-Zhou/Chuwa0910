1.  list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md

    > Done. CHUWA0910/ShortQuestions/hw50/annotations.md 

2.  Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies

    > Spring Cloud -> API Gateway -> Eureka (registry) -> LoadBalance -> Hystrix Circuit breaker -> Config Server -> Kafka -> Docker

3.  What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

    > Resilience patterns: way to help prevent cascading and otherwise catastrophic microservices application failures. 
    > Time out: a time out preventsa microservice from waiting too long for another microservice. 
    > Circuit breaker: If a system call results in an error, the circuit breaker is opened and doesn't allow any calls to pass through. 

4.  Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers 
    a. https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#main-features-of-microservices

    > Q: What are the benefits and drawbacks of Microservices?
    > A: Benefits: 
    > * Self-contained, independent deployment module. 
    > * A greater degree of scalability and agility.
    > Drawbacks: 
    > * Due to the complexity of the architecture, testing and monitoring are more difficult.
    > * Complex development.  
    
    > Q: Write difference between Monolithic, SOA and Microservices Architecture.
    > A: Monolithic: all the software components of an application are bundled together tightly. SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), it is a group of services interacting or communicating with each other. Microservice: it involves structuring an application in the form of a cluster of small, autonomous services modeled around business domain. 

    > Q: Explain how independent microservices communicate with each other.
    > A: (1) HTTP/Rest (2) Websockets for streaming (3) a broker server program like RabbitMQ, Kafka. 

5.  how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
    a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview-question/
    b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions

    > load balance is a way to dispatch request for the server to make the system works fluently and to avoid the several problems. Like Single Point of Failure, one server goes down, the whole application will be interrupted, and Overloaded Servers, request may overload the capacity of server. 
    > Different Categories of LB: (1) L4 Load Balancer: Network Load Balancing (2) L7 Load Balancer: Application load balancer or HTTP Load Balancer. (3) Global Server Load Balancing: Clouad LB. 
    > Algorithms of LB: Round Robin, Weighted Round Robin, Least Connection Mehtod 
    > Reverse Proxy Server: a feature of a load banlance. 

6.  How to do service discovery?

    > Eureka register service by serviceid, monitor service health status, auto-register new services
    > Replication: service discovery must be implemented in a way that a failure of one server does not cause the entire service discovery to fail.
    > Crash detection: Eureka expects the microservices to regularly send heartbeats.
