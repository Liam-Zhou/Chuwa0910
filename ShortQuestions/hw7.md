### 1.Explain how the below annotations specify the table in database?

```
@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow' ")
private String name ;

@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false)
private String studentName;
```


The @Column annotation can be used to specify the table in database by using the name property. If the name property is not specified, the column name will be inferred from the property name.

In the first example, the columnDefinition property is used to specify the column definition in the database. The columnDefinition property can be used to specify the data type, length, and other constraints for the column. In this case, the columnDefinition property specifies that the name column is a varchar(255) column with a default value of John Snow.

In the second example, the name property is used to specify the column name in the database. The length property is used to specify the maximum length of the column. The nullable property is used to specify whether the column can be null. The unique property is used to specify whether the column must be unique. In this case, the STUDENT_NAME column is a varchar(50) column
that cannot be null and must be unique.

### 2. What is the default column names of the table in database for @Column?
```
@Column
private String firstName;
@Column
private String operatingSystem;
```
If you use the @Column annotation without specifying a name attribute, the default column name is derived from the field name. So, the default column names in the database table would be firstName and operatingSystem, respectively.

### 3. What are the layers in the springboot application ? what is the role of each layer?


Spring Boot applications typically follow a layered architecture, with each layer responsible for a specific task. The four layers in a Spring Boot application are:

* Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for handling user interactions and displaying data. It typically consists of controllers, views, and templates.
* Business Layer: This layer contains the core business logic of the application. It is responsible for validating and processing data, and performing business operations.
* Persistence Layer: This layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data from a database. It typically consists of repositories and data access objects (DAOs).
* Database Layer: This layer contains the actual database, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle.
  
The layers are typically arranged in a hierarchy, with the presentation layer at the top and the database layer at the bottom. Each layer communicates with the layer below it, but not the layers above it.
