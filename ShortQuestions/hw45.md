1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to [annotaitons.md](http://annotaitons.md/)

2. What is the authentication?

It verifies the identity like username and password.
3. What is the authorization?

Authorization is the process of granting or denying permissions for specific actions or resource access.
4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

Authorization：API不同角色能不能访问
5. What is HTTP Session?

HTTP session is the mechanism to maintain the information. It would store in the servers, when the user access the data, it would pass the session id to the servers.
6. What is Cookie?

Cookie is a piece of data stored in the web browser. It helps to remember the user information and preferences. 
7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

Session: in servers; temporary, expires when the user closes the browser or after a certain period; could be large size; more security

Cookie: in web browser; has specific expire date; limited size; can be vulnerable to security issues
8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
application?

You can use sessions for secure server-side storage of user information and cookies for lightweight client-side data storage and tracking, ensuring a seamless user experience across the application.
9. What is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact and self-contained way to represent information between parties as a JSON object, often used for authentication and data exchange in web applications.
10. What is the spring security filter?

The Spring Security filter is a part of the Spring Security framework that intercepts and processes HTTP requests to provide authentication, authorization, and other security features for web applications.
11. Describe how do JWT work

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) work by encoding and digitally signing claims (data) with a secret key, allowing for secure and compact representation of information, and enabling authentication and authorization in applications.
12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

Yes
13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?
AuthenticationFilter?

UserDetailService: interface that Spring Security uses to retrieve user information from a data source (like a database).

AuthenticationProvider:responsible for authenticating users

AuthenticationManager:It manages a collection of AuthenticationProviders and delegates the authentication process to them.

AuthenticationFilter:processes incoming requests and extracts authentication information, such as username and password, from the request
14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

It’s difficult to scale the application horizontally because sessions are often stored on the server.

It can be overcomed by using JWT or OAuth 2.0
15. how to get value from application.properties?

`@value`
16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

HttpSecurity http is used to configure security rules related to access control and authorization.

AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth s used to configure the authentication mechanism and specify how Spring Security should handle user authentication. You use this method to define the source of user credentials.
17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access or perform after they've been authenticated.
