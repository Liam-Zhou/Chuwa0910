2. What is the authentication?  
**Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or information. User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user when that user logs in to a computer system.**
3. What is the authorization?  
**For the user to perform certain tasks or to issue commands to the network, he must gain authorization. It determines the extent of access to the network and what type of services and resources are accessible by the authenticated user. Authorization is the method of enforcing policies.**
4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
   | S.NO | AUTHENTICATION                                                                                                          | AUTHORIZATION                                                                                                                       |   |   |
   |------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|
   | 1.   | In authentication process, the identity of users are checked for providing theaccess to the system.                     | While in authorization process, person’s or user’s authorities are checked foraccessing the resources.                              |   |   |
   | 2.   | In authentication process, users or persons are verified.                                                               | While in this process, users or persons are validated.                                                                              |   |   |
   | 3.   | It is done before the authorization process.                                                                            | While this process is done after the authentication process.                                                                        |   |   |
   | 4.   | It needs usually user’s login details.                                                                                  | While it needs user’s privilege or security levels.                                                                                 |   |   |
   | 5.   | Authentication determines whether the person is user or not.                                                            | While it determines What permission do user have?                                                                                   |   |   |
   | 6.   | Generally, transmit information through an ID Token.                                                                    | Generally, transmit information through an Access Token.                                                                            |   |   |
   | 7.   | Example : Employees in a company are required to authenticate through the network before accessing their company email. | Example : After an employee successfully authenticates, the system determines what information the employees are allowed to access. |   |   |
   |      |                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                     |   |   |
5. What is HTTP Session?  
**An HTTP session is a way of maintaining a connection between a client and a server over the HTTP protocol. An HTTP session allows the server to store information about the client, such as preferences, login status, or shopping cart items, across multiple requests and responses. An HTTP session can also help the client to keep track of its own state, such as the current page or form data**
6. What is Cookie?  
**A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent by a web server to a web browser and stored by the browser. A cookie can contain information such as the user’s preferences, login status, or shopping cart items. A cookie is used to identify the user and provide a personalized experience on the website. A cookie can also help the website to track the user’s behavior and preferences, such as the pages visited, the time spent, or the items clicked.**
7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?  

8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?  

9. What is JWT?  
**JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It's a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.**

10. What is the spring security filter?  
**Spring Security Filter is a component of Spring Security that intercepts HTTP requests and performs security checks on them. Spring Security Filter is implemented as a servlet filter that can be configured in the web.xml file or through Java annotations. Spring Security Filter delegates the authentication and authorization logic to other components, such as AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationProvider, AccessDecisionManager, and so on. Spring Security Filter also provides features such as session management, CSRF protection, logout handling, and exception handling.**
11. decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)  
**The process of using JWT between a client and a server is as follows:  
    i. The client requests access to a protected resource from the server, such as an API endpoint, by providing some credentials, such as a username and password.  
    ii. The server validates the credentials and generates a JWT for the client. The server encodes the header, payload, and signature using Base64url Encoding RFC 4648 and concatenates them with periods. The server sends the JWT back to the client in the response.  
    iii. The client stores the JWT locally, such as in the browser’s local storage or a cookie. The client can also decode the JWT and read the payload to get information about the user or the resource.  
    iv. The client sends the JWT to the server in every subsequent request to access the protected resource, such as in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema.  
    v. The server receives the JWT and verifies its signature using the same algorithm and secret or public key that was used to generate it. The server also checks if the JWT is valid, not expired, and not tampered with. If the JWT is valid, the server grants access to the protected resource and sends back the response to the client**
12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?
    AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?  
**Using session is a way of storing data on the server side that can be accessed by different web pages. However, it also has some disadvantages that you should be aware of. Some of the disadvantages of using session are:  
    It can cause performance overhead on the server, especially if you store large amounts of data or have many concurrent users. This is because session data is stored in server memory and needs to be serialized and deserialized when using state server or SQL server as the session mode.   
    It can create problems with concurrency and scalability, as session state maintains a read-write lock on the session data. This means that no two concurrent requests can be made by the same user by default, which can affect the user experience and responsiveness of the application.  
    It can make your application stateful, which goes against the stateless nature of the HTTP protocol. This can lead to issues with sharing links, bookmarking pages, or refreshing the browser, as the session state may not contain the expected data or may be lost.  
    It can pose security risks, as session data can be hijacked or tampered with by malicious users. You need to ensure that you use secure and encrypted communication channels, such as HTTPS, and implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect your session data.**
15. how to get value from application.properties?  
**There are several ways to get the value from application.properties in Spring Boot. One of the most common ways is to use the @Value annotation, which allows you to inject the value of a property into a field or a method parameter. For example, if you have a property named language in your application.properties file, you can use @Value ("$ {language}") to get its value in your Java class.  
    Another way is to use the Environment interface, which provides access to the properties from different sources, such as application.properties, system properties, or environment variables.  
    A third way is to use the @ConfigurationProperties annotation, which allows you to bind the properties from application.properties to a POJO class.**
16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
18. (Optional)Assuming that the Redbook UI supports dark mode and multiple
    languages, when a user signs in, their preferences (such as dark-mode=true and
    lang=eng) will be read from the database. For the assignment, you can set a value
    like in the course materials; there is no need to actually read from a database.
    After signing in, observe the response header and cookie for related information.
    Continue calling other APIs and observe the request header or cookie for other
    information. After signing in, Spring Security will generate a session, and the
    JSESSIONID will be in the cookie. Try to obtain the session content through the
    JSESSIONID, and then log the session content using the log4j tool. Write the code based on the 08_04 branch.
