1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to
   annotaitons.md
2. What is the authentication?
> Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, ensuring that the user is who they claim to be. It typically involves collecting credentials, such as a username and password, and validating them.
3. What is the authorization?
> Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has permission to access a specific resource or perform a particular action. It involves defining and enforcing access control rules.
4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
> The main difference between authentication and authorization is that authentication verifies a user's identity, while authorization determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access based on their authenticated identity.
5. What is HTTP Session?
> An HTTP Session is a mechanism used to maintain state information on the server for a user across multiple requests. It is often used to store user-specific data, such as login status and user preferences.
6. What is Cookie?
> A cookie is a small piece of data sent by a server and stored on a client's machine. Cookies are often used for tracking user sessions and storing small pieces of information, such as user preferences or login tokens.
7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
> The key difference between a Session and a Cookie is that a Session is stored on the server, while a Cookie is stored on the client's machine. Sessions are typically more secure, while cookies are convenient for client-side storage.
8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?
> To keep user information across the application, you can use sessions to store user-specific data on the server, and cookies to maintain user identification and preferences on the client's side. For example, you can store the user's session data on the server and use cookies to store a session identifier or token.
9. What is JWT?
> JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact, self-contained way to represent information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are often used for securely transmitting information between a client and a server, typically in the context of authentication and authorization.
10. What is the spring security filter?
> The Spring Security filter is a part of the Spring Security framework that processes incoming requests and enforces security rules. It includes various filters like UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter for handling login, BasicAuthenticationFilter for handling HTTP Basic authentication, and many others.
11. describe how do JWT work
> JWT works by encoding claims (such as user information or permissions) into a JSON object, signing it with a secret key, and then returning the token to the client. The client sends the token in subsequent requests, and the server can verify the token's integrity and extract information from it.
12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
> Spring Security provides password encoding mechanisms to securely store and compare passwords. Common encoders include BCryptPasswordEncoder, PasswordEncoder, and MessageDigestPasswordEncoder.
13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?
    AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)
> In Spring Security, UserDetailsService is responsible for retrieving user details, AuthenticationProvider validates credentials, AuthenticationManager coordinates the authentication process, and UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter handles the login process.
14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
> A disadvantage of using Sessions is that they consume server memory and can become a scalability bottleneck. To overcome this, you can use stateless authentication mechanisms like JWT, and store session data in external stores like Redis.
15. how to get value from application.properties?
> To get values from application.properties in a Spring application, you can use the @Value annotation or the Environment object to access properties defined in the configuration file.
16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
> The configure(HttpSecurity http) method in Spring Security is used to configure security rules for HTTP requests, including specifying which URLs require authentication and authorization. configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) is used to configure the authentication mechanism.
17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
> Spring Security authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be, and authorization determines what actions or resources users are allowed to access based on their authenticated identity. These are fundamental concepts in securing web applications using Spring Security.
