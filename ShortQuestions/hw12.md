# hw12 - Spring Basic

1.  List all the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md
2.  What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benefits of using springboot?  
Spring is an open-source, comprehensive framework for building enterprise-level Java applications, providing features for dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and various application components.  
Springboot is an extension of Spring that simplifies the development and deployment of stand-alone, production-ready Java applications. It provides opinionated defaults, auto-configuration, and embedded servers, making it ideal for building microservices and web applications with minimal setup.
3.  What is IOC and What is DI?  
IOC, Inversion of Control, is a design principle where the control over the flow and execution of a program is shifted from the program itself to an external framework or container. In Spring, IoC means that the control over the creation, management, and wiring of application beans is managed by the Spring container.  
DI, Dependency Injection, means the dependencies are injected into it rather than the object creating or managing its own dependencies. This is typically achieved through constructor injection, setter injection, or method injection.
4.  What is @ComponentScan?  
`@ComponentScan` defines where the spring need to scan the bean definitions and thus generate the beans.
5.  How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotation?   
    In XML:  
    ```java
    <context:component-scan base-package="com.example.myapp" />
    ```
    Using annotation:
    ```java
    @Configuration
    @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.myapp")
    ```
6.  What is @SpringbootApplication?
    `@SpringbootApplication` indicate that a class is the primary configuration class for the application. Always come with the following three annotations: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
7.  How many ways wo can define a bean?  
    - Using built-in annotations: `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, `@ContollerAdvice`;
    - Using annotations `@Configuration` and `@Bean` to define customer beans;
    - Write beans in XML file: 
        ```<bean id="dataNucleusChuwaNoComponent" class="com.chuwa.beanClass"></bean>``` 
8.  What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?  
    For `@Component`, the default bean name is the class name with the lower case of the first letter;  
    For `@Bean`, the efault bean name is just the method name.
9.  What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?
    `@component`  is a generic annotation used to manage a class as a bean; however, `@Service`, `@Repository` can typically mark a class as service or repository.
10. How many annotations we can use to inject the bean?  
    `@Autowired`, `@Resource`, `@Inject`.
11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?  
    Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, and Field Injection. Constructor Injection is the best way, since it has:
    - Immutability;
    - Explicit Dependencies;
    - Test-Friendliness;
    - Avoid Circular Dependencies;
    - Compatibility with Java Records.
12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the Spring pick one bean to inject if no primary.  
    Using annotation `@Primary` when defining the bean class. If no primary, Spring will using `@Qualifier` and name matching to find the bean to inject.
13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?  
    BeanFactory is the basic bean container interface, capable of bean instantiation and wiring; ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory, provides more complicated features, like eager initialization, AOP features, internationalization, event handling mechanisms, BeanPostProcessor, etc.
14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.  
    - Singleton: Service classes, utility classes, DAO classes.
    - Prototype: Form-backing beans, session-scoped beans.
    - Request: Controllers, request-scoped beans.
    - Session: User sessions, shopping carts.
    - Application: Caches, application-wide services.
    - WebSocket: WebSocket controllers, WebSocket-scoped beans.
15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any questions if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to explain it in class)  
    Suppose we have a Person class and a Job class, and we want to configure a Person bean with a Job dependency.
    - Create the Person and Job classes:
    ```java
    public class Person {
        private String name;
        private Job job;
    }
    
    public class Job {
        private String title;
    }
    ```
    - Create an XML configuration file:
    ```java
    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
        <!-- Define the Job bean -->
        <bean id="job" class="com.example.Job">
            <property name="title" value="Software Engineer" />
        </bean>

        <!-- Define the Person bean with a dependency on the Job bean -->
        <bean id="person" class="com.example.Person">
            <property name="name" value="Alice" />
            <property name="job" ref="job" />
        </bean>
    </beans>
    ```
    - Load and use the Spring application context in your Java code:
    ```java
    import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
    import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
    
            // Retrieve the Person bean from the context
            Person person = (Person) context.getBean("person");
    
            // Access the properties and dependencies of the Person bean
            System.out.println("Name: " + person.getName());
            System.out.println("Job Title: " + person.getJob().getTitle());
        }
    }
    ```
