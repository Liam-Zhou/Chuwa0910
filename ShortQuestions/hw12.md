### 1. List all of the annotations in Java Spring Boot Security

* @EnableWebSecurity: Enables Spring Security for the application.
* @Configuration: Marks a class as a Spring configuration class.
* @Bean: Marks a method as a Spring bean.
* @Autowired: Marks a field or constructor parameter for autowiring by Spring.
* @PreAuthorize: Authorizes access to a method or controller handler.
* @PostAuthorize: Authorizes access to a method or controller handler after it has been executed.
* @Secured: Annotates a method or controller handler to require a specific role or roles.
* @RolesAllowed: Annotates a method or controller handler to require a specific role or roles.
* @PermitAll: Annotates a method or controller handler to allow access to everyone, regardless of authentication or authorization.
* @IgnoreSecurity: Annotates a method or controller handler to ignore Spring Security completely.

### 2. What is the authentication ?

Authentication in Spring Boot Security is the process of verifying the identity of a user. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as passwords, one-time pins, or biometric data. Once a user has been authenticated, Spring Security will provide them with a security token. 
This token can be used to access protected resources in the application.

### 3. What is the authorization ?

Authorization in Spring Boot Security is the process of determining what resources a user is allowed to access. This is done based on the user's role or roles. Spring Security provides a variety of ways to implement authorization,
such as role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).

### 4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

Authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, while authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. Authentication is the first step in any security system, and authorization is the second step.

Authentication is typically done through a login process, where the user provides their credentials, such as a username and password. Once the user has been authenticated, the system knows who they are. Authorization is then used to determine what resources the user is allowed to access.

For example, a user might be authenticated as a "manager", but they might not be authorized to access the payroll system. This is because the payroll system is a sensitive resource that only certain users should have access to.

Authentication and authorization are both important for protecting applications and data from unauthorized access. By implementing both authentication and authorization, you can help to ensure that only authorized users have access to the resources they need.

### 5. What is HTTP Session ?

An HTTP session is a way for a web server to keep track of a user's activity across multiple requests. This is done by storing a session ID in a cookie on the user's browser. When the user makes a request to the web server, the session ID is sent back to the server.
The server can then use the session ID to retrieve the user's session data.

Spring Boot Security uses HTTP sessions by default to store authentication information. 
This means that when a user authenticates to the application, their authentication information is stored in the HTTP session.
This allows the user to access protected resources in the application without having to authenticate on every request.

### 6.	What is Cookie? 

A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on the user's browser. Cookies can be used for a variety of purposes,
such as storing user preferences, keeping track of items in a shopping cart, or tracking a user's browsing activity.

Spring Boot Security uses cookies to store the session ID. This allows the user to access protected resources in the application without having to authenticate on every request.

### 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

The main difference between a session and a cookie is that a session is stored on the server, while a cookie is stored on the browser. This means that a session is still alive even if the user closes their browser. However, a cookie is deleted when the user closes their browser.

Another difference is that a session is typically used to store authentication information, while a cookie is typically used to store user preferences.

### 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?

To use session and cookie to keep user information across the application, we can use the following steps:

* When a user authenticates to the application, we create a session and store the user's authentication information in the session.
* We generate a session ID and store it in a cookie on the user's browser.
* We send the cookie to the user's browser.
* When the user makes a request to the application, the cookie is sent back to the server.
* The server retrieves the user's session data from the session ID.
* The server uses the session data to determine whether the user is authenticated and authorized to access the requested resource.

For example, we can use session and cookie to keep track of the items in a user's shopping cart. When a user adds an item to their shopping cart, we can store the item in the user's session. When the user proceeds to checkout, we can retrieve the items in their session and display them on the checkout page.

### 9.	What is JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

JWTs are composed of three parts, separated by dots (.)

* Header: The header contains information about the token, such as the type of token and the signing algorithm used.
* Payload: The payload contains the claims, which are the data associated with the token. Claims can be anything, such as the user's ID, name, email address, and roles.
* Signature: The signature is a digital signature that is used to verify the authenticity of the token. It is generated using the header, payload, and a secret key.
  
### 10.	What is the spring security filter?

A Spring Security filter is a component that intercepts all incoming requests to an application and performs some action on them. Spring Security provides a variety of built-in filters, such as filters for authentication, authorization, and session management. Developers can also create their own custom filters.

Spring Security filters are configured using the ```<security:http>``` element in the Spring Security configuration file. The following example shows how to configure a filter for authentication:

```xml
<security:http>
  <security:intercept-url pattern="/**" access="ROLE_USER"/>

  <security:authentication-provider>
    <security:user-service>
      <security:user name="user" password="password" authorities="ROLE_USER"/>
    </security:user-service>
  </security:authentication-provider>

  <security:filter-security-interceptor/>
</security:http>
```
In the above example, the ```<security:intercept-url>``` element specifies that all requests to the application require the user to be authenticated in the ```ROLE_USER``` role. The ```<security:user-service>``` element defines a simple user service that contains a single user with the username "user" and the password "password". The ```<security:filter-security-interceptor>``` element enables the Spring Security filter chain.
