1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md.

2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?

    1. Spring Framework
       
       Spring is a powerful and flexible framework aimed at simplifying Java application development, particularly for enterprise-level applications. It provides a comprehensive programming model, built on top of Java EE (Enterprise Edition) that aims to streamline the development process and infrastructure support. Spring handles infrastructure so developers can focus on application-level code.

       Key Features of Spring:
       
       - Inversion of Control (IoC): Through Dependency Injection (DI), Spring promotes loose coupling, making code more modular, easier to manage and test.
       - Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Helps in separating cross-cutting concerns like logging and transaction management.
       - Data Access: Eases the data access using JDBC and ORM frameworks like Hibernate.
       - Transaction Management: Coordinates transactions across Java objects to improve efficiency.
       - Model-View-Controller (MVC): An HTTP and Servlet-based framework providing hooks for extension and customization.
       - Security: Configurable security processes integrated in the Spring application.

    2. Spring Boot
       
       Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the initial setup and development of new Spring applications. It uses convention over configuration software design paradigm that aims to decrease the number of decisions that developers need to make.

       Key Features of Spring Boot:
       
       - Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures your Spring application based on the JAR dependencies you added in the project.
       - Standalone: Spring Boot applications are web servers that can run independently and don’t need an external server.
       - Production Ready: Helps in monitoring and managing production applications through actuators.
       - No Code Generation: It reduces lots of development time and increases productivity.
    
    3. Benefits of Using Spring Boot
       
       - Simplified Dependency Management: Spring Boot handles dependency management by providing default configurations, which helps to avoid lots of boilerplate code.
       - Auto-Configuration: It provides a set of default configurations, settings, and libraries so you can get started with minimal configuration.
       - Embedded HTTP Servers: It has built-in Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow servers, which helps in developing web applications with ease.
       - Microservices Ready: It’s easier to build Spring-based microservices applications and provides a way to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications.
       - Spring Initializr: Offers a quick way to generate Spring Boot application setups and configurations easily from a web interface or IDE.
       - Actuator: Provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application.

3. What is IOC and What is DI?

    1. Inversion of Control (IoC)
       
       - Definition:
       
         Inversion of Control (IoC) is a programming principle where the control over the execution of certain objects or frameworks is taken away from the program itself and managed by a controller or container. It's primarily aimed at improving modularity, making systems more configurable and modular, reducing the dependency between modules, and increasing the ease of testing and maintenance.

       - Example:
       
         In a traditional program, the flow of control is managed by the main application (a top-down approach). However, with IoC, the control flow is inverted, and an external controller manages it.

    2. Dependency Injection (DI)
       
       - Definition:
         
         Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that implements IoC by constructing objects and injecting their dependencies at runtime, rather than at compile time. It promotes the decoupling of classes and their dependencies, making the system more modular, flexible, and testable.

       - Example:
         
         Suppose there is a class Car, and it depends on an interface Engine. Without DI, the Car class might create a specific instance of Engine. With DI, the Car class is created with an instance of Engine passed to it (injected), so it's not directly dependent on a specific Engine implementation.

     3. Relationship between IoC and DI
        
        Dependency Injection is a form of IoC. While IoC is a broad concept that can be implemented in various ways (like event, service locator pattern, etc.), DI specifically deals with the aspect of IoC where dependencies are "injected" into the dependent object.

        Illustrative Example with Java:
        
        ```
        // Without DI
        public class Car {
           Engine engine = new PetrolEngine();
        } 

        // With DI
        public class Car {
           Engine engine;

           public Car(Engine engine) {
              this.engine = engine; // engine is injected through the constructor
           }
        }
        ```

4. What is @CompnonentScan?

    1. @ComponentScan in Spring
      
       - Definition:
         
         @ComponentScan is an annotation used in Spring Framework and Spring Boot to specify the packages to scan for annotated components. It configures component scanning directives for use with @Configuration classes. The annotation is used to discover beans and to automatically create bean definitions for found classes, thus eliminating the need for manual bean configuration.

       - Core Features:
         
         - Scanning of Components:
           
           It scans specified packages and their sub-packages to identify Spring components like @Controller, @Service, @Repository, and @Component.

         - Auto-Configuration:
           
           Automatically configures our application based on the beans we have in your project.

         - Customization:
           
           We can customize the base package and filters to include or exclude specific components.
      
      2. In Spring Boot:
         
         Spring Boot applications with @SpringBootApplication annotation implicitly have component scanning enabled, with the main configuration class's package as the base package to start the scanning.

5. How to define which package Spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?

    1. Using XML Configuration
       
       In XML configuration, We can use ```<context:component-scan>``` to define the base package that Spring needs to scan for components. Below is an example:
        
       ```
       <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

          <context:component-scan base-package="com.example.myapp" />
       </beans>
       ```

    2. Using Annotation Configuration
         
       With annotation-based configuration, the @ComponentScan annotation is used to specify the package to scan. Here is an example:
         
       ```
       @Configuration
       @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.myapp")
       public class AppConfig {
          // class body...
       }
       ```

6. What is @SpringbootApplication?

    The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a convenience annotation in Spring Boot applications, which is often used on the main class. It encompasses several other Spring annotations, providing a simplified and consolidated way to set up a Spring application. Specifically, @SpringBootApplication combines three annotations:

    1. @EnableAutoConfiguration:
       
       Enables automatic configuration of the Spring Application Context, attempting to guess and configure beans that we are likely to need based on the libraries on the classpath.
       
       Spring Boot auto-configuration attempts to automatically configure our Spring application based on the jar dependencies that we have added.
    
    2. @ComponentScan:
       
       Enables automatic scanning for Spring components, including @Configuration classes, @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, and others.
       
       It automatically picks up classes from the package where the application is located and its sub-packages.
    
    3. @Configuration:
       
       Indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions.
       
       It’s used alongside @Bean annotations on methods to indicate that they should be registered as beans in the Spring application context.

7. How many ways we can define a bean?

    1. Annotation-Based Configuration:
       
       - @Component:
         
         General-purpose stereotype annotation to annotate a bean class. Spring automatically detects and registers the annotated class as a bean.

       - @Service, @Repository, @Controller:
         
         Specialized stereotypes of @Component for specific use cases.

       - @Bean:
         
         Used in a configuration class to declare a bean from a method.

    2. Java-Based Configuration:
       
       - @Configuration:
         
         Indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.

    3. XML-Based Configuration:
       
       Declaring beans in an XML file and using the ```<bean>``` tag.
       
       ```
       <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
          http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

          <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
             <!-- configure the bean properties here -->
          </bean>
       </beans>
       ```
 
    4. Autodetection with Component Scanning:
       
       - @ComponentScan:
         
         Indicates that Spring should automatically discover beans and register them with the application context.

8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?

    1. For @Component
       
       The default bean name for a class annotated with @Component is the class name with the first letter in lowercase. It's derived from the non-qualified class name by turning its first character to lowercase. If the name consists of a single character, that character is converted to lowercase.
       
       ```
       @Component
       public class MyComponent { }
       ```
       
       Default bean name: "myComponent"

    2. For @Bean
       
       For a @Bean annotated method, the default bean name is the method name.
       
       ```
       @Configuration
       public class AppConfig {
    
          @Bean
          public MyBean myBean() {
              return new MyBean();
          }
       }
       ```
       
       Default bean name: "myBean"

    3. Override Default Name
       
       We can override the default bean name by providing a value to the @Component or @Bean annotation.
       
       ```
       @Component(“customBeanName")
       public class MyComponent { }
       ```
       ```
       @Bean(“customBeanName”)
       public MyBean myBean() {
          return new MyBean();
       }
       ```
       In these cases, the bean name will be "customBeanName".

9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?

    1. @Component
       
       @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. It indicates that the class is a spring component, and its instance can be created and managed by the Spring framework. Spring will automatically detect the classes annotated with @Component through classpath scanning and register them as beans in the application context.
    
    2. @Service
       
       @Service is a specialization of the @Component annotation. It has the same functionality as @Component, but it's used for classes that indicate a specific service's implementation in the business layer. It's a naming convention benefit, to indicate the specific role of our class.
  
    3. @Repository
       
       @Repository is another specialization of the @Component annotation, specifically for DAOs (Data Access Objects). Besides being used to mark a class as a Spring bean, it has an additional special role in exception translation. It converts SQL exceptions into Spring's DataAccessException.

10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?

    1. @Autowired
       
       This annotation is used for auto-wiring in Spring. By default, it performs a by-type autowiring.
       
       ```
       @Autowired
       private MyService myService;
       ```

    2. @Inject
       
       This is a standard Java annotation for dependency injection, originating from JSR-330. It works similarly to Spring's @Autowired annotation.
       
       ```
       @Inject
       private MyService myService;
       ```

    3. @Resource
       
       This annotation is a part of JSR-250 and it has ‘name’ attribute which is used to indicate the name of the resource that needs to be injected. It works for both setter injection and field injection.
        
       ```
       @Resource(name=“myService")
       private MyService myService;
       ```

    4. Constructor Injection
       
       We can also inject beans through constructors. This is often considered a good practice as it helps in achieving immutability and ensures that the bean is fully initialized when it's being used.
       
       ```
       private final MyService myService;

       @Autowired
       public MyController(MyService myService) {
           this.myService = myService;
       }
       ```
    
    5. Setter Injection
       
       Though field injection is popular, setter injection can also be an option. It provides more control over the injection process.
       
       ```
       private MyService myService;

       @Autowired
       public void setMyService(MyService myService) {
           this.myService = myService;
       }
       ```

    6. @Qualifier
       
       This annotation is used along with @Autowired to avoid confusion when multiple instances of a bean type exist. @Qualifier specifies which exact bean instance should be wired.
       
       ```
       @Autowired
       @Qualifier("specificMyService")
       private MyService myService;
       ```

11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection (How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?

    1. Constructor Injection:
       
       - How it Works: Dependencies are injected through the constructor of the class.
       - Advantages:
         
         - Helps in creating immutable objects because you can mark the injected class fields as final.
         - Ensures dependency resolution at the time of bean creation, leading to a fail-fast mechanism.
       
       - Disadvantages:
         
         - Can lead to a large number of constructor arguments if a class has many dependencies.

    2. Setter Injection:
       
       - How it Works: Dependencies are injected through setter methods of the class.
       - Advantages:
         
         - More flexible as it allows the reassignment of dependencies.
         - Better suited for optional dependencies.
       
       - Disadvantages:
         
         - Allows the modification of dependencies after the initialization of the bean, which could lead to potential issues.

    3. Field Injection:
       
       - How it Works: Dependencies are injected directly into the fields of the class.
       - Advantages:
         
         - It’s concise and does not require boilerplate code like setter methods.
       
       - Disadvantages:
         
         - Makes the code harder to test because you cannot mock the dependencies using traditional testing methodologies.
         - The dependencies cannot be marked as final.

    4. Which Way is Better and Why?
       
       Constructor injection is generally recommended for several reasons:

       - Immutability: It allows for marking fields as final, which ensures the fields are immutable, leading to safer multi-threading.
       - Testing Ease: It’s easier to write unit tests, as you can pass dependencies as constructor arguments without needing reflections or custom injection mechanisms.
       - Explicit Dependencies: Dependencies are explicit, and it’s easy to see what dependencies are required to create a new instance of a class.

12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? And how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.

    1. Setting a Primary Bean
       
       In a situation where we have multiple beans of the same type, we can designate one of them as the primary bean by using the @Primary annotation. This tells Spring to prioritize this bean when multiple candidates are present for injection.

    2. Choosing a Specific Bean without Primary
       
       If there is no primary bean specified and we still want to wire a specific bean, we can use the @Qualifier annotation to provide the name of the bean that we want to inject.

       Alternatively, we can also use the @Resource annotation, which allows us to specify the name of the bean to be injected. This can also be an option when dealing with multiple beans of the same type.

13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?

    1. BeanFactory
       
       - Basic Container: BeanFactory provides the fundamental features needed for dependency injection. It is used for simple scenarios and has a low memory footprint.
       - Lazy Initialization: By default, it initializes the beans lazily. It means the bean is created only when it is requested, which can be efficient in terms of memory utilization.
       - Less Overhead: It is lighter in terms of memory consumption and resources, suitable for applications with limited resources like mobile or applet-based applications.
       - Limited Functionality: It provides fewer features compared to ApplicationContext. It lacks support for various functionalities like event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create a bean, various lookup mechanisms, etc.
       
       ```
       XmlBeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource("beans.xml"));
       MyBean myBean = (MyBean) factory.getBean("myBean");
       ```

    2. ApplicationContext
       
       - Advanced Container: ApplicationContext is a more advanced and feature-rich container compared to BeanFactory. It includes everything BeanFactory offers and adds more enterprise-specific functionality.
       - Eager Initialization: By default, ApplicationContext initializes all the singleton beans at the time of creation. It reduces the overhead during the request/response cycle but could lead to more memory consumption at the start.
       - More Features: ApplicationContext provides many additional features like event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create a bean, various lookup mechanisms, AOP, etc.
       - Internationalization: It provides functionalities for message sourcing, to make the application internationalization capable.

       ```
       ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
       MyBean myBean = (MyBean) context.getBean("myBean");
       ```

    3. Main Differences
       
       - Performance and Resource Utilization: BeanFactory is lighter and has less overhead. ApplicationContext has more features but consumes more resources.
       - Feature Set: ApplicationContext offers a richer set of features including AOP, messaging, etc. BeanFactory is basic and used for simple DI operations.
       - Initialization: BeanFactory lazily initializes beans, while ApplicationContext initializes singleton beans at the startup.
       - Use Cases: Use ApplicationContext for most applications. BeanFactory could be used in scenarios where resources are constrained and we need a basic DI container.

14. What is the Scope of a Bean? And list the examples for each scope.

    1. Singleton Scope (@Scope("singleton") or just @Singleton):
       
       Description: In this scope, Spring IoC container creates only one instance of the bean, and this single instance is shared and reused every time the bean is needed. It's the default scope.
       
       ```
       @Component
       @Scope("singleton")
       public class SingletonBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```
       or
       ```
       @Component
       @Singleton
       public class SingletonBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```

    2. Prototype Scope (@Scope("prototype")):
       
       Description: A new instance is created each time a bean is requested or injected. It’s used for stateful beans where each request needs its own separate instance.
       
       ```
       @Component
       @Scope("prototype")
       public class PrototypeBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```

    3. Request Scope (@Scope("request") or @RequestScope):
       
       Description: A new bean is created for each HTTP request. This scope is only valid in the context of a web-based Spring application.
       
       ```
       @Component
       @Scope("request")
       public class RequestScopedBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```
       or
       ```
       @Component
       @RequestScope
       public class RequestScopedBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```

    4. Session Scope (@Scope("session") or @SessionScope):
       
       Description: A new bean is created for each HTTP session by the container. It’s also specific to web applications.
       
       ```
       @Component
       @Scope("session")
       public class SessionScopedBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```
       or
       ```
       @Component
       @SessionScope
       public class SessionScopedBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```

    5. Application Scope (@Scope("application") or @ApplicationScope):
       
       Description: The bean is scoped at the application level. It's similar to a singleton but in the context of a web application. It's shared between all the servlets and filters in the same application.
       
       ```
       @Component
       @Scope("application")
       public class ApplicationScopedBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```
       or
       ```
       @Component
       @ApplicationScope
       public class ApplicationScopedBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```

    6. WebSocket Scope (@Scope("websocket")):
       
       Description: The bean is scoped for a particular WebSocket session. Each WebSocket connection has its own instance of the bean.
       
       ```
       @Component
       @Scope("websocket")
       public class WebSocketScopedBean {
          // class body
       }
       ```

15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean?
    
    Assuming we have a Person class that has a dependency on the Address class:

    Person class:
    ```
    public class Person {
       private String name;
       private Address address;
    
       // getters and setters
    }
    ```
    
    Address class:
    ```
    public class Address {
       private String street;
       private String city;
    
       // getters and setters
    }
    ```

    Steps to Configure Beans Using XML:
    
    - Create an XML configuration file, say applicationContext.xml.
    - Define the Address bean with property values.
    - Define the Person bean and inject the Address bean into it using the <property> element.

    Here is how the applicationContext.xml file would look:
    
    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

       <!-- Define Address Bean -->
       <bean id="address" class="com.example.Address">
           <property name="street" value="123 Main Street" />
           <property name="city" value="Spring City" />
       </bean>

       <!-- Define Person Bean and Inject Address Bean -->
       <bean id="person" class="com.example.Person">
           <property name="name" value="John Doe" />
           <property name="address" ref="address" />
       </bean>
    </beans>
    ```

    In this example:

    Two beans, person and address, are defined using the ```<bean>``` element.

    The ```<property>``` element is used to inject values and dependencies. For injecting primitive values like String, we use the value attribute. For injecting other beans, we use the ref attribute to refer to the bean ID of the dependency.

    The class attribute is used to specify the fully qualified class name of the bean.

    Load Application Context and Get Bean
    
    ```
    ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
    Person person = (Person) context.getBean("person");
    ```
