What is the authentication?
```text
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user by obtaining some sort of credentials and using those credentials to verify the user's identity. Authentication is distinct from authorization, which is the process of giving individuals access to system objects based on their identity.
```

What is the authorization?
```text
Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do something
```

What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
```text
Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. Authorization is the process of verifying what you have access to.
```

What is HTTP Session?
```text
HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. The server does not know who the client is and what requests the client made before. The session is a conversational state between client and server and it consists of multiple requests and responses between client and server.
```

What is Cookie?
```text
A cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with the next request to the same server. Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser â€” keeping a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
```

What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
```text
Session is a conversational state between client and server and it consists of multiple requests and responses between client and server. Cookie is a small piece of information that is persisted between the multiple client requests.
Session is stored at server side. Cookie is stored at client side.
Session object is accessible through HttpSession. Cookie is accessible through HttpServletRequest.getCookies().
```

How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
application?
```text
We can use session to store the user information, and use cookie to store the session id
```

How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
application?
```text
We can use session to store the user information, and use cookie to store the session id
```


What is JWT?
```text
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
```

What is the spring security filter?
```text
Spring Security Filter is an implementation of javax.servlet.Filter, it is the core of Spring Security. It is used to provide security to web applications. It is an implementation of Servlet Filter that delegates authentication and authorization to the AuthenticationManager and AccessDecisionManager.
```

decribe how do JWT work
```text
The JWT is composed of three parts: a header, a payload (claims), and a signature. The header and payload are Base64 encoded and concatenated with a period as a separator. The signature is computed by passing the header and payload through a hashing algorithm along with a secret key.
```

Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
```text
Yes, I use BCryptPasswordEncoder
```

What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?
AuthenticationFilter?
```text
UserDetailService: This interface is used to retrieve user-related data. It has one method named loadUserByUsername() which can be overridden to customize the process of finding the user.
AuthenticationProvider: This interface is used to validate the instance of Authentication class. It has one method named authenticate() which can be overridden to customize the authentication process.
AuthenticationManager: This interface is used to authenticate an Authentication object. It has one method named authenticate() which can be overridden to customize the authentication process.
AuthenticationFilter: This class is used to authenticate the user by using the username and password. It extends AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter class.
```

What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
```text
The disadvantage of session is that it will consume the server memory, and it will not work in the distributed system, we can use JWT to overcome the disadvantage
```

how to get value from application.properties?
```text
@Value("${key}")
```

What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
```text
configure(HttpSecurity http): This method is used to configure security functionalities like csrf, sessionManagement, and add rules to protect resources based on various conditions.
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): This method is used to configure the AuthenticationManagerBuilder which is used to build an AuthenticationManager instance.
```

What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
```text
Authentication:
AuthenticationManager: The core interface for authentication, with the most commonly used implementation being ProviderManager.
AuthenticationProviders: These are components that the ProviderManager delegates to, in order to perform various types of authentication, such as DaoAuthenticationProvider (for user details stored in databases), LdapAuthenticationProvider (for LDAP-based authentication), and more.
UserDetailsService: An interface to retrieve user details from a custom data store. It's often used by DaoAuthenticationProvider.
Authentication Objects: Typically, an application would obtain an Authentication request object (often UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken), containing the credentials. Once the authentication is successful, this object is fully populated and represents the authenticated user.

Authorization:
GrantedAuthority: Represents an authority granted to an Authentication object. It can represent roles, permissions, or other claims.
AccessDecisionManager: The core interface for making access control decisions, with some common implementations being AffirmativeBased, 
Security Expressions: These allow for fine-grained access control based on the result of expressions. For example, a method can be annotated with @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')") to ensure that it can only be invoked by users with the 'ADMIN' role.
