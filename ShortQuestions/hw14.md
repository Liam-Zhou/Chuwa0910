what is cucumber?

What is the lifecircle of Junit?
```text
1. @BeforeAll: executed once before the start of all tests. It is used to perform time intensive activities, for example, to connect to a database. Methods marked with this annotation need to be defined as static to work with JUnit.
2. @AfterAll: executed once after all tests have been finished. It is used to perform clean-up activities, for example, to disconnect from a database. Methods annotated with this annotation need to be defined as static to work with JUnit.
3. @Before: executed before each test. It is used to prepare the test environment (e.g., read input data, initialize the class).
4. @After: executed after each test. It is used to cleanup the test environment (e.g., delete temporary data, restore defaults). It can also save memory by cleaning up expensive memory structures.
5. @Test: identifies a method as a test method.
```

Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
```text
Yes, @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static).
```

What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?
```text
Mockito is a mocking framework, JAVA-based library that is used for effective unit testing of JAVA applications. Mockito is used to mock interfaces so that a dummy functionality can be added to a mock interface that can be used in unit testing.
```

What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
```text
@Mock: creates mock implementation for the class.
@InjectMocks: injects mock or spy fields into tested objects automatically.
```
What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
```text
Stubbing is a technique used in unit testing when the unit being tested depends on an object that is not yet implemented. With stubbing, a dummy version of the dependent object is created and used in the test, allowing the unit to be tested without dependencies on other units.
```

what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
```text
ArgumentMatchers is a class that provides static methods that are used for argument matching.
```

what is Hamcrest Matchers
```text
Hamcrest is a framework for software tests. It supports creating customized assertion matchers.
```

do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
```text
@Mock creates a completely mock or fake object that has no behavior until you define it. 
@Spy wraps a real object so it keeps the original behavior unless explicitly overridden
```

What is assertion?
```text
An assertion is a statement in the JavaTM programming language that enables you to test your assumptions about your program. For example, if you write a method that calculates the speed of a particle, you might assert that the calculated speed is less than the speed of light.
```

If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature?
and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of
tests?
```text
Unit tests: test the smallest unit of code, usually a method or function
Integration tests: test how multiple components work together
Pressure tests: test the system under a heavy load
Custom tests: test the system against the requirements
```
