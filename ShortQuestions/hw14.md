### What is selenium?

Selenium is a popular open-source automation framework used for testing web applications. It provides a set of tools and libraries that allow you to write automated tests for web applications across different browsers and platforms. Selenium is widely used by software testers and developers to automate repetitive tasks and ensure the quality of web applications.

### What is cucumber?

Cucumber is a behavior-driven development (BDD) tool that helps you write test scenarios in plain English. It uses a Gherkin syntax to describe the desired behavior of the application, and then generates code to execute those scenarios. Cucumber is often used in conjunction with other testing frameworks, such as Selenium, to automate the execution of test scenarios.

### What is JMeter?

JMeter is an open-source load testing tool that allows you to simulate the behavior of multiple users accessing an application. It can be used to test the performance and scalability of web applications, as well as to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks. JMeter is widely used by software testers and developers to perform load testing on web applications.

### What is the lifecycle of JUnit?

The lifecycle of a JUnit test consists of the following phases:

* Setup: The setup phase is used to initialize the test fixture and any other resources that are required for the test.
* Execution: The execution phase is where the actual test code is executed.
* Verification: The verification phase is used to check whether the test passed or failed.
* Teardown: The teardown phase is used to clean up any resources that were created during the test.

### Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

Yes, the @BeforeAll method should be a class-level method that is static. This is because the @BeforeAll method is only executed once per class, and it is therefore important that it is static so that it is accessible from all instances of the class.

### What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?

Mockito is a mocking library for Java that allows you to create mock objects that can be used to test your code. Mockito is widely used by software developers to stub out dependencies and isolate their code for testing.

Mockito has a few limitations. For example, it cannot be used to mock final classes or methods. Additionally, Mockito can sometimes be difficult to use when testing code that relies heavily on reflection.

There are a few tools that can help you to use Mockito more effectively. One such tool is the Mockito Extension for IntelliJ IDEA. This plugin provides a number of features that make it easier to use Mockito, such as code completion and refactoring support.

### What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

The @Mock annotation is used to create a mock object. A mock object is a type of object that can be used to stub out dependencies and isolate your code for testing.

The @InjectMocks annotation is used to inject a mock object into a field. This can be useful when you are testing code that relies on a particular dependency.

### What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?

Stubbing is a technique that is used to define the behavior of a mock object. When you stub a method on a mock object, you are telling Mockito what value to return when that method is called.

### what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

Mockito ArgumentMatchers are a set of classes that can be used to create custom matchers for method arguments. This can be useful when you want to stub a method that takes multiple arguments.

### what is Hamcrest Matchers

Hamcrest Matchers are a set of matchers that can be used to create more complex matchers. Hamcrest Matchers can be used to match any type of object, including primitives, collections, and objects.

### do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

The @Spy annotation is used to create a spy object. A spy object is a type of mock object that can also be used to call real methods on the object that it is spying on.

The main difference between a spy object and a mock object is that a spy object will call real methods on the object that it is spying on unless you explicitly stub the method. This can be useful when you want to test code that relies on a particular dependency, but you also want to be able to control the behavior of the dependency in some cases.

### What is assertion?

An assertion is a statement that is used to verify that a condition is true. Assertions are often used in tests to check whether a particular piece of code is working correctly.

### If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature?
and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of
tests?

There are several different types of tests that you can write for a new feature, each with its own purpose. Here are a few of the most common types of tests:

```* Unit tests:``` Unit tests are the most basic type of test and are designed to test individual units of code, such as functions, classes, or modules. Unit tests are typically written by developers and are executed very frequently to ensure that the code is working correctly.

```* Integration tests:``` Integration tests are designed to test how different units of code work together. They are typically written by testers and are executed less frequently than unit tests.

```* End-to-end tests:``` End-to-end tests are designed to test the entire application from start to finish. They are typically written by testers and are executed even less frequently than integration tests.

```* Acceptance tests:``` Acceptance tests are designed to ensure that the application meets the requirements of the stakeholders. They are typically written by testers and are executed at the end of the development process.

```* Performance tests:``` Performance tests are designed to test the performance of the application under load. They are typically written by testers and are executed in a staging environment before the application is released to production.

```* Security tests:``` Security tests are designed to test the security of the application. They are typically written by security experts and are executed in a staging environment before the application is released to production.

The specific types of tests that you write for a new feature will depend on the complexity of the feature and the risks associated with the feature. For example, a simple feature with no external dependencies may only require a few unit tests. However, a complex feature with many external dependencies may require a combination of unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests.
