Q1. List all annotations.

See annotations.md
*********************************
Q2. Briefly reading: https://www.techgeeknext.com/spring-boot/spring-aop-interview-questions
*********************************
Q3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?

AOP, implement cross-cutting concerns, defines functionality that is required in multiple places across an application. 
We can add new functionality before or after a method is executed like transaction management, logging or security which cut across
multiple types and objects. 
*********************************
Q4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP? 

Advantage: 
1. Easy to configure
2. Implemented in pure java, separate class loader is not required. 
3. utilize spring's ioc container for dependency injection.
4. create aspects using @AspectJ annotation based or using XML based. 
5. Integrate cross-cutting concerns into classes. 

Disadvantage: 
1. debug the aop framework-based application is challenge.
2. work with public class, not for private, protected or default visibility.
3. cannot be advised by other aspect. 
*********************************
Q5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP? 

An aspect is a cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts. 
A standard class tagged with @Aspect annotation can be used to implement an aspect. 
*********************************
Q6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP? 

A pointcut is an `expression that chooses one or more join points at which advice is given`. 
Pointcuts can be defined `using expressions or patterns`. 
It supports a number of expressions that correspond to the join points.
*********************************
Q7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?

A join point is `a place` in the application where an AOP aspect is applied. 
It could also be a specific advice execution instance. 
A join point in AOP can be a method execution, exception handling, changing the value of an object variable, and so on.
*********************************
Q8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?

The advice is an action which we take before or after the method execution. 
In the Spring AOP framework, there are five types of advice: 
before, after, after-returning, after-throwing, and around advice. 
Advice is taken at a specific join point.

Q10. When to use Spring Batch?

Batch processing includes typical tasks like reading and writing to files, transforming data, reading from or writing to databases, create reports, import and export data and things like that. 
Often these steps have to be chained together or you have to create more complex workflows where you have to define which job steps can be run in parallel or have to be run sequentially etc. 
That's where a framework like Spring Batch can be very handy.

**Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.
*********************************
Q11. How Spring Batch works?

Step - A Step that delegates to a Job to do its work.

ItemReader - Strategy interface for providing the data.

ItemProcessor - Interface for item transformation.

ItemStreamWriter - Basic interface for generic output operations.
*********************************
Q12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

Spring Batch can be scheduled using Cron Job.
*********************************
Q13. What is the cron expression?

The cron expression in SB is similar to the traditional cron syntax used in unix operating syste,.

      @Schdeule(cron = "0 0 12 * * ? ") This will run the method at 12:00PM EVERYDAY

Rules:
Seconds (0-59)

Minutes (0-59)

Hours (0-23)

Day of month (1-31)

Month (1-12 or JAN-DEC)

Day of week (0-7 or SUN-SAT, where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday)
*********************************
Q14. What is the spring task?


task scheduling and asynchronous execution capabilities provided by Spring through its TaskExecutor and @Async features. 
These features allow you to schedule and execute tasks asynchronously within a Spring-based application.

Example 1: using @Scheduled (task scheduling)

        import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
        import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

        @Service
        public class MyScheduledService {

            @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000) // This method will be executed every 5 seconds
            public void myScheduledMethod() {
                // Your scheduled task logic here
            }
        }

Example 2: using @Async (asynchronous execution)

Detail: When a method is annotated with @Async, it will be executed in a separate thread, 
allowing your application to continue processing other tasks without waiting for the asynchronous method to complete.

        import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async;
        import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

        @Service
        public class MyAsyncService {

            @Async
            public void myAsyncMethod() {
                // Your asynchronous task logic here
            }
        }
*********************************
Q15. When to use Spring task?

1. Scheduled Tasks
2. Asynchronous Processing
3. Concurrency Control: controlling the number of concurrent threads used for task execution.
4. Batch Processing:If you're building batch processing applications, Spring Task can be very helpful for managing the scheduling and execution of batch jobs.
5. Responsive Web Applications: In web applications, you can use asynchronous execution to prevent blocking the main thread, especially when dealing with slow external services or performing background operations while keeping the UI responsive.
6. High Throughput and Scalability: improve application performance by avoiding thread blocking. 
7. Error Handling and Retry: You can implement retry mechanisms and error handling strategies to ensure the robustness of your application.
