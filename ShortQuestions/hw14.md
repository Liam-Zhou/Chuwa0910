# hw14 - AOP
1.  List all the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
2.  Briefly reading: https://www.techgeeknext.com/spring-boot/spring-aop-interview-questions
3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?  
    AOP is used to modularize concerns that cross-cut an application, such as logging, security, transaction management, and error handling, without scattering related code throughout the application's core business logic.
4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?  
    Advantages:
    - easy to configure.
    - utilizes Spring's IOC container for dependency injection.  
    
    Disadvantages:
    - Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects.
    - Only methods with a public visibility will be recommended.
5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?  
    An aspect is a cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts. A standard class tagged with the @Aspect annotation can be used to implement an aspect.
6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?  
    A pointcut is an expression that chooses one or more join points at which advice is given. Pointcuts can be defined using expressions or patterns. It supports a number of expressions that correspond to the join points.
7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?  
   A join point is a place in the application where an AOP aspect is applied. It could also be a specific advice execution instance. A join point in AOP can be a method execution, exception handling, changing the value of an object variable, and so on.
8.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?  
    The advice is an action which we take before or after the method execution. In the Spring AOP framework, there are five types of advice: before, after, after-returning, after-throwing, and around advice. Advice is taken at a specific join point.

10. When to use Spring Batch?  
    Spring Batch is a framework provided by the Spring ecosystem for processing large volumes of data efficiently and reliably. It is particularly well-suited for batch processing scenarios, where you need to perform data processing tasks like ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data import/export, and data cleaning in a systematic and scalable manner.
11. How Spring Batch works?  
    - step: A Step that delegates to a Job to do its work.
    - ItemReader: Strategy interface for providing the data. Implementations are expected to be stateful and will be called multiple times for each batch.
    - ItemProcessor: Interface for item transformation. Given an item as input, this interface provides an extension point which allows for the application of business logic in an item oriented processing scenario.
    - ItemStreamWriter: Basic interface for generic output operations. Class implementing this interface will be responsible for serializing objects as necessary.
12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?  
    - Create a Spring Batch Job
    - Configure a Job Launcher
    - Define a Scheduling Mechanism, like Spring's Task Scheduling, Cron Expressions, `@Scheduled` annotation.
    - Create a Scheduled Method
    - Configure Scheduling
13. What is the cron expression?  
    A cron expression is a string representing a schedule or time-based trigger in a human-readable format. It's commonly used in various software and systems for scheduling tasks, such as job execution, batch processing, and automation.
    ┌───────────── Second (0-59)  
    │ ┌───────────── Minute (0-59)  
    │ │ ┌───────────── Hour (0-23)  
    │ │ │ ┌───────────── Day of the month  
    │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── Month (1-12 or JAN-DEC)  
    │ │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── Day of the week

14. What is the spring task?  
    Spring task allow you to schedule and execute tasks at specific times or intervals. Spring offers task scheduling through the TaskScheduler interface and the @Scheduled annotation.
15. When to use Spring task?  
    under these scenarios: Automated Task Execution, batch processing, Scheduled Jobs, Data Cleanup and Maintenance, etc.
16. What is Filter and any filter example?  
    Filters are part of the Java Servlet API and are used to perform tasks such as request/response modification, authentication, logging, and more.
17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?  
    interceptor is a component or middleware that allows you to intercept and process HTTP requests and responses. Interceptors are commonly used to execute code before and after the request is handled by a controller or servlet. They are typically used for cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication, logging, request modification, and more.
18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?  
    - preHandle: This method is executed before the actual handler is invoked.
    - preHandle: This method is executed after the actual handler is invoked.
19. What is Swagger?  
    Swagger is a framework that simplifies the process of designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful web services and APIs. Swagger is widely used to improve the development and adoption of APIs by making them more accessible, understandable, and testable.
