1:What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
```text
AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple parts of the codebase and are difficult to modularize using traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques. Examples of cross-cutting concerns include logging, security, error handling, and performance monitoring.
```
2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
```text
Advantages:
Modularity and Separation of Concerns
Code Reusability
Centralized Configuration
Dynamic Proxies
Disadvantages:
Limited Support for Aspect Inheritance
Limited Join Point Expressiveness
Performance Overhead
Limited Support for Compile-Time Weaving
Aspect Configuration Complexity
```
What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
```text
An aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes. Transaction management is a good example of a crosscutting concern in J2EE applications. In Spring AOP, aspects are implemented using regular classes (the schema-based approach) or regular classes annotated with the @Aspect annotation (the @AspectJ style).
```
What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
```text
A pointcut is a predicate that matches join points. Advice is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join point matched by the pointcut (for example, the execution of a method with a certain name). The concept of join points as matched by pointcut expressions is central to AOP, and Spring uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language by default.
```
What is JoinPoint in Spring AOP?
```text
A join point is a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception. In Spring AOP, a join point always represents a method execution.
```

What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
```text
Advice is an action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include “around,” “before” and “after” advice. (There are other advice types as well, which will be discussed later.) Many AOP frameworks, including Spring, model an advice as an interceptor, maintaining a chain of interceptors around the join point.

When to use Spring Batch?
```text
Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive batch framework designed to enable the development of robust batch applications vital for the daily operations of enterprise systems. Spring Batch builds upon the productivity, POJO-based development approach, and general ease of use capabilities people have come to know from the Spring Framework, while making it easy for developers to access and leverage more advanced enterprise services when necessary.
```

How Spring Batch works?
```text
The JobLauncher is used to start a Job.
The Job consists of one or more Steps.
Each Step includes an ItemReader to retrieve data, an ItemProcessor to process data, and an ItemWriter to write data.
The Steps are executed sequentially.
Data is read, processed, and written in chunks, which helps manage memory and ensures transactional integrity.
Listeners and error handling mechanisms can be applied at various points in the batch processing lifecycle.
The Job Repository stores metadata about the Job and its execution status.
Logs and reports can be generated to monitor and troubleshoot batch processing.
```



How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
```text
Spring Batch provides a TaskScheduler implementation that can be used to schedule jobs. The TaskScheduler implementation is based on the Spring TaskExecutor abstraction and can be used with any TaskExecutor implementation.
```

What is the cron expression?
```text
A cron expression is a string consisting of six or seven subexpressions (fields) that describe individual details of the schedule. These fields, separated by white space, can contain any of the allowed values with various combinations of the allowed characters for that field. The fields are as follows:
```

What is the spring task?
```text
Spring Task provides support for scheduling tasks based on expressions using cron or fixedDelay/fixedRate.
```
When to use Spring task?
```text
Spring Task provides support for scheduling tasks based on expressions using cron or fixedDelay/fixedRate.
```

What is Filter and any filter example?
```text
A filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource (a servlet or static content), or on the response from a resource, or both.
```
What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
```text
An interceptor is a class that implements the HandlerInterceptor interface. It provides three methods that we can use to perform operations before sending the request to the controller, after sending the request to the controller, and after sending the response to the client.
```

In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
```text
preHandle() – Called before the handler execution, returns a boolean value, “true” : continue the handler execution chain; “false”, stop the execution chain and return it.

postHandle() – Called after the handler execution, allow manipulate the ModelAndView object before render it to view page.
```

What is Swagger?
```text
Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs.
