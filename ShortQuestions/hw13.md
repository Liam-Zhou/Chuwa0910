*********************************
Q1. List all of annotations 

See annotations.md
*********************************
Q2. What is the authentication? 

Verify the identity of the user, checking password, username.
*********************************
Q3. What is the authorization?

Verify the user has the permission to access the resource. general user, Admin user. 
*********************************
Q4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization? 

authentication verifies the identity of a user or system, 
while authorization controls what that authenticated entity is allowed to do or access.
*********************************
Q5. What is HTTP Session? 

A server side storage. 
Cannot access by user. 
A mechanisms that maintain stateful interactions between a web server and a client and maintain user-specific information
*********************************
Q6. What is Cookie? 


A cookie is a small text file used by websites to store information on a user's device for various purposes.
*********************************
Q7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie? 

Cookies are produced by the web server and sent to the client through HTTP headers. 
Session is a server-side storage. Produced and managed by the web server.
*********************************
Q8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application? 

JSESSIONID, JWT token, user preference, cart information. 
*********************************
Q9. What is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, self-contained token format used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, often for authentication and authorization in web applications.
*********************************
Q10. What is the spring security filter? 

Spring Security filter is part of the Spring Security framework, implementing security measures like authentication and authorization. It filters HTTP requests, applying security rules and configurations.
*********************************
Q11. Describe how do JWT works? 

It works by encoding and digitally signing information into a compact, self-contained token, typically in three parts: header, payload, and signature.
*********************************
Q12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password? 

Argon2, bcrypt
*********************************
Q13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter? 

UserDetailsService:

A `UserDetailsService` is an interface in Spring Security that provides a method to look up UserDetails by a username. UserDetails typically include the user's username, password, and granted authorities (roles).
Custom implementations of UserDetailsService can be used to retrieve user details from various data sources, such as databases, LDAP, or custom user stores.
AuthenticationProvider:

An `AuthenticationProvider` is responsible for authenticating a user's credentials (e.g., username and password). It takes an Authentication object as input and, if successful, returns an Authentication object with the user's authenticated information.
AuthenticationProviders are typically linked to one or more UserDetailsServices and handle the actual authentication process.
AuthenticationManager:

The `AuthenticationManager` is a central component in Spring Security that orchestrates the authentication process. It typically delegates the authentication request to one or more configured AuthenticationProviders.
When a user tries to log in, the AuthenticationManager checks the credentials against the configured AuthenticationProviders and returns an authenticated Authentication object if successful.

AuthenticationFilter (sometimes referred to as Authentication Processing Filter):

An `AuthenticationFilter` is part of the Spring Security filter chain and is responsible for processing and authenticating user login requests.
It intercepts login requests, extracts the user's credentials, and passes them to the AuthenticationManager for authentication. If successful, it sets up the user's security context.
Common implementations include UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter for handling username and password-based authentication and JwtAuthenticationFilter for handling JWT-based authentication.
*********************************
Q14. What is the disadvantage of Session? How to overcome the disadvantage? 

Sessions consume server resources and may lead to scalability and load balancing challenges.

Use stateless authentication (e.g., JWT), store minimal data in cookies, employ in-memory databases or distributed caching, and implement session timeout and cleanup strategies.
*********************************
Q15. How to get value from application.properties? 


1. Using @Value Annotation:

        import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;

        @Value("${property.name}")
        private String propertyValue;

2. Using Environment Bean (Spring-specific):
    
        import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;

        @Autowired
        private Environment env;
        
        String propertyValue = env.getProperty("property.name");

3. Using @ConfigurationProperties (Spring-specific): 

        @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "property")
        @Component
        public class PropertyConfig {
            private String name;
            private String value;
            // standard getters and setters
        }

        @Autowired
        private PropertyConfig propertyConfig;
        
        String name = propertyConfig.getName();
        String value = propertyConfig.getValue();
*********************************
Q16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)? 

configure(HttpSecurity http) is used to configure security settings such as authorization, authentication, and session management.
*********************************
Q17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization? 

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. Authorization is the process of verifying that the user has permission to access a resource.
