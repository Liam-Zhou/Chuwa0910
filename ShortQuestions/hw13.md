1.  List all the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md
    Done
2.  What is the authentication?  
    Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity attempting to access a resource. It ensures that the claimed identity is accurate and trustworthy.
3.  What is the authorization?  
    Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity attempting to access a resource. It ensures that the claimed identity is accurate and trustworthy.
4.  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?  
    Authentication is focused on who is this person, and authorization is focused on what is this person allowed to do.
5.  What is HTTP Session?  
    HTTP session is a mechanism used to maintain stateful communication between a web server and a web client. Sessions enable the server to recognize and remember a specific user across multiple requests and responses, allowing for personalized and continuous interactions within a web application.
6.  What is Cookie?  
    A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server sends to a user's web browser for further use to identify oneself and maintain stateful information.
7.  What is the difference between Session and Cookie?  
    Session is stored on server side, while cookie is stored on client side. 
8.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?  
    Server will store session information, and clients will send requests with cookies containing information like Session ID so that the server can relate this request to its session, thus keep user information across different requests.
9.  What is JWT?  
    JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an authentication method for user to prove their identity. JWT is self-contained and compact format. 
10. What is the spring security filter?  
    The Spring Security filter chain is a sequence of filters that are applied to incoming HTTP requests before they reach the application's controllers or endpoints. Each filter has a specific responsibility in the security process.
11. Describe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)  
    When login, server will create a JWT using header and payload along with a secret to generate a signature, and return all to the user except the secret. When user use this JWT again, server only need to verify the signature using secret to authenticate.
12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
    Spring uses BCryptPasswordEncoder as password encoder. `BCryptPasswordEncoder.encode()` to encode password, `BCryptPasswordEncoder.matches()` to check password.
13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
    - `UserDetailsService` is an interface in Spring Security used to retrieve user details from a data store. It typically loads user information, including username, password, and authorities/roles, from a database or any other source.
    - `AuthenticationProvider` is an interface responsible for performing authentication and verifying user credentials. It allows you to customize how user authentication is handled.
    - `AuthenticationManager` is responsible for managing authentication within Spring Security. It uses one or more `AuthenticationProvider` instances to authenticate a user.
    - `AuthenticationFilter` is responsible for intercepting and processing incoming authentication requests.
14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?  
    Session store data in server side, which consume resources each time a request arrives. Also, it is hard to manage session data among large amount of work nodes. To overcome these, we can consider using session replication or distributed caching mechanisms like Redis, or using stateless authentication like JWT. 
15. how to get value from application.properties?  
    Use annotation `@Value`; Use the `Environment` Object.
16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?  
    - `configure(HttpSecurity http)` is used to define security configurations related to access control, request handling, and authorization in your Spring Security-enabled application. This method is responsible for setting up rules that determine which URLs require authentication, what types of authentication are accepted, and which users are allowed to access specific resources.
    - `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)` is responsible for configuring the authentication mechanism for your application. This is where you define how users are authenticated, which authentication providers or mechanisms are used, and how user details are verified.
17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
    Authentication is focused on who is this person, and authorization is focused on what is this person allowed to do.

18. (Optional)Assuming that the Redbook UI supports dark mode and multiple languages, when a user signs in, their preferences (such as dark-mode=true and lang=eng) will be read from the database. For the assignment, you can set a value like in the course materials; there is no need to actually read from a database. After signing in, observe the response header and cookie for related information. Continue calling other APIs and observe the request header or cookie for other information. After signing in, Spring Security will generate a session, and the JSESSIONID will be in the cookie. Try to obtain the session content through the JSESSIONID, and then log the session content using the log4j tool. Write the code based on the 08_04 branch.
    - a. get cookie by HttpServletRequest
    - b. Get cookie by @CookieValue
    - c. Get Session
