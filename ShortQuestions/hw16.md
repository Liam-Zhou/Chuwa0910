1. List all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md

2. Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies.

    Microservice architecture involves developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.
    
    Key components and tools often include:
    
    1. Service Discovery Tools like Eureka, Consul, or Zookeeper for locating services for load balancing and failover.
    2. API Gateways such as Zuul or Kong to handle requests from clients.
    3. Containers and Orchestration Tools like Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and management.
    4. Distributed Tracing Systems like Zipkin or Jaeger for monitoring and troubleshooting.
    5. Message Brokers such as Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.
    6. Configuration Management tools like Spring Cloud Config or Consul Config.
    7. Circuit Breakers like Hystrix to prevent failure cascades.
    8. Load Balancers like NGINX or HAProxy for distributing network traffic.
    9. Monitoring Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack for logging, monitoring, and visualization.

3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

    Resilience patterns in microservices are design strategies to handle failures and ensure the system remains functional.
    
    Circuit Breaker: A pattern used to prevent a network or service failure from cascading to other services. When failures reach a certain threshold, the circuit breaker trips, and for a predetermined time, all attempts to invoke the service will fail immediately. This allows failing services to recover.

4. Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers 

    a. https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#mai n-features-of-microservices

    The article on InterviewBit discusses the main features of microservices, their advantages, and challenges. Important questions could include:
    
    1. What are the main features of microservices?
    2. What are the benefits and challenges of adopting a microservices architecture?
    
    Answers:
    
    1. Main features include decentralized governance, independent deployment, failure isolation, and technology diversity.
    2. Benefits include scalability, flexibility, faster development, and better fault isolation. Challenges involve complexity in managing multiple services, network latency, and a need for cultural changes in teams.

5. How to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
    
    a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview
-question/
    b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions

    Load balancing in microservices is crucial for distributing client requests across multiple instances of a service.
    
    1. Strategies include Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash.
    2. Tools like NGINX, HAProxy, or AWS ELB can be used.
    3. It ensures high availability and optimal resource utilization.
    4. Implementation involves considerations like session persistence, health checks, and dynamic service discovery.

6. How to do service discovery?

    In microservices, service discovery is the process of automatically detecting services within a network.
    
    1. Tools like Eureka, Zookeeper, or Consul can be used.
    2. It helps services to locate each other and communicate in a dynamic environment like a cloud.

7. What are the major components of Kafka?

    Kafka consists of Brokers, Topics, Partitions, Producers, Consumers, Consumer Groups, and Zookeeper.

8. What do you mean by a Partition in Kafka?

    A partition is a division of a topic in Kafka. It allows Kafka to parallelize processing by splitting the data across multiple brokers.


9. What do you mean by zookeeper in Kafka and what are its uses?

    Zookeeper manages the state of Kafka brokers and performs leader election for partitions.
    
    It's essential for Kafka to function but newer versions aim to replace it with KRaft (Kafka Raft).


10. Can we use Kafka without Zookeeper?

    Traditionally, Kafka cannot function without Zookeeper. However, with KIP-500, Kafka aims to remove this dependency.

11. Explain the concept of Leader and Follower in Kafka.

    Each partition in Kafka has one leader and multiple followers. The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition, while followers replicate the leader.

12. Why is Topic Replication important in Kafka? What do you mean by ISR in Kafka?

    Replication ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
    
    ISR (In-Sync Replicas) is a set of message replicas that are synchronized with the leader.

13. What do you understand about a consumer group in Kafka?

    A Consumer Group is a collection of Kafka consumers that jointly consume messages from one or more topics.

14. How do you start a Kafka server?

    Starting Kafka involves running the Zookeeper instance followed by starting the Kafka broker.

15. Tell me about some of the real-world usages of Apache Kafka.

    Kafka is used for building real-time data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and log aggregation.

16. Describe partitioning key in Kafka.

    It's used to determine the partition within a topic where a message will be sent.

17. What is the purpose of partitions in Kafka?

    Partitions increase scalability and allow parallel processing of data.

18. Differentiate between Rabbitmq and Kafka.

    RabbitMQ is traditionally used for message queuing, while Kafka is designed for high-throughput distributed streaming.

19. What are the guarantees that Kafka provides?

    Kafka guarantees message durability, high throughput, fault tolerance, and order within a partition.

20. What do you mean by an unbalanced cluster in Kafka? How can you balance it?

    It refers to uneven data and load distribution across Kafka brokers. Rebalancing involves redistributing partitions across the brokers.

21. In your recent project, are you a producer or consumer or both?

    Both.

22. In your recent project, Could you tell me your topic name?

    BlogPosts:Comments:UserActivity:BlogPostEdits:

23. In your recent project, How many brokers do you have? How many partitions for each topic? How many data for each topic.

    Only one.

24. In your recent project, which team produce what kind of event to you and you producer what kind of events?

    Authors and Content Creators:

    1. Events Produced: Authors and content creators produce events related to blog posts.
    2. Examples: Creation of new blog posts, edits to existing posts, and deletion of posts. Readers and Subscribers:
    3. Events Produced: Readers and subscribers can generate events based on their interactions with the blog posts and the server.
    4. Examples: Viewing a blog post, liking a post, leaving comments, subscribing to notifications, and sharing posts.

25. What is offset?
    
    An offset is a unique identifier for each record within a partition. It denotes the position of a message within a partition.
