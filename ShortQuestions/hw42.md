# 4. what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
JPA: JPA use JDBC to CRUD database, and also transfer result from database to Java Entities.
Using JPA, we can map a Java class or bean to a table. The members of the class map columns in the table.
When this mapping is defined, JPA can write queries on its own. It takes the responsibility of creating and executing queries for CRUD operations.

Hibernate: Hibernate is an ORM(Object relational Mapping) framework.
It provides a way to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa. 
Hibernate helps developers to develop persistent classes following natural Object-oriented idioms without worrying about the underlying database where the data is stored.

# 5. What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?
HikariCP is a popular and high-performance Java connection pooling library. It provides a means for applications to efficiently manage and reuse database connections rather than creating a new connection every time an application needs to talk to a database, which is resource-intensive.

Benefits of connection pool:
1. Establishing a new database connection is time-consuming. By reusing already established connections, connection pooling can significantly speed up database operations.
2. Managing a pool of active connections and reusing them means fewer resources (like memory and sockets) are used. This leads to a smaller footprint and less overhead.
3. Connection pools can be configured to have a maximum number of connections. This ensures that resources are not overwhelmed by too many concurrent connections, thereby preventing potential system crashes or slowdowns.

# 6. What is the  @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
@OneToMany: is used to define a many-to-one relationship between two entities.
Example: A post can have many comments, but a comment can only belong to one post.
@ManyToOne: is used to define a one-to-many relationship between two entities.
Example: A post can have many comments, but a comment can only belong to one post.
@ManyToMany: is used to define a many-to-many relationship between two entities.
Example: A post can have many viewers, and a viewer can view many posts.

# 7. What is the  cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what
* cascade = CascadeType.ALL: is used to propagate all operations (including Hibernate-specific ones) from a parent entity to a child entity.
orphanRemoval = true: means child entities that are no longer referenced by a parent entity should be automatically removed.

* Other CascadeType:
CascadeType.PERSIST: If the parent entity is persisted (saved), the related child entities will also be persisted.
Situation: when you want to save the child entities automatically with the parent.
CascadeType.MERGE: If the parent entity is merged (i.e., updated), the related child entities will also be merged.
Situation: when you want to update the child entities automatically with the parent.
CascadeType.REMOVE: If the parent entity is removed (deleted), the related child entities will also be removed.
Situation: when you want to delete the child entities automatically with the parent.
CascadeType.REFRESH: If the parent entity is refreshed, the related child entities will also be refreshed.
Situation: when you want to update the state of the child entities automatically with the parent.
CascadeType.DETACH: If the parent entity is detached from the current persistence context, the related child entities will also be detached.
Situation: when you want to detach the child entities automatically with the parent.

# 8. What is the  fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?
fetch = FetchType.LAZY: is used to specify that a child entity should be lazily fetched from the database.
Situation: when you want to load the child entities only when you need them.
fetch = FetchType.EAGER: is used to specify that a child entity should be eagerly fetched from the database.
Situation: when you want to load the child entities immediately.

# 9. What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?
JPA naming convention:
The name of the method must start with findBy, readBy, queryBy, countBy, or getBy.
The name of the method must end with the name of the entity property that you want to use for filtering records.
The name of the method must not contain the SQL keywords SELECT, FROM, WHERE, AND, OR, IN, or LIKE.
The name of the method should use camel case.
We don't need to implement the method by ourselves, Spring Data JPA (interface) will generate the method for us.

# 14. What is JPQL?
JPQL: (Java Persistence Query Language) is a query language that allows us to execute queries against entities stored in a relational database.

# 15. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
@NamedQuery: is used to define a query that is statically bound to an entity.
@NamedQueries: is used to define multiple named queries.

# 16. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
@Query: is used to define a query that is dynamically bound to an entity.
We write the sql or JPQL in the repository interface.

# 17. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
HQL: (Hibernate Query Language) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties.
Criteria Queries: is a programmatic, type-safe way to express a query.

# 18. What is EntityManager?
EntityManager: is used to create and remove persistent entity instances, to find entities by their primary key, and to query over entities.

# 19. What is SessionFactory and Session?
SessionFactory: is used to create Session objects.
Session: is used to get a physical connection with a database.

# 20. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
Transaction: is a set of operations that must be performed as a single unit of work.
We can manage our transaction by using @Transactional annotation.

# 21. What is hibernate Caching?
Hibernate Caching: is a mechanism that allows Hibernate to store the result of a query in a cache, so that, when the query is executed again, the result is retrieved from the cache instead of being regenerated by executing the query against the database.

# 22. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
First-level cache: is associated with the Session object and is enabled by default.
Second-level cache: is associated with the SessionFactory object and is disabled by default.

# 23. How do you understand @Transactional? (不要clone，要⾃⼰抄写并测试transactional，https://github.com/TAIsRich/tutorial-transaction)
@Transactional: is used to specify the transactional behavior of a method or a class.

# 24. Write a simple factory design pattern.
```
interface Wheel {
    public float getDiameter();
    public float getWidth();
}

class CarWheel implements Wheel {
    protected float diameter;
    protected float width;

    public CarWheel(float diameter, float width) {
        this.diameter = diameter;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public float getDiameter() {
        return diameter;
    }

    public float getWidth() {
        return width;
    }
}

class WheelFactory {
    public static Wheel makeWheel (float diameter, float width) {
        return new CarWheel(diameter, width);
    }
}

class TestWheelFactory {
  
    public static void main(String args[]) {
    
        Wheel carWheel = WheelFactory.makeWheel(15, 215);
  
        System.out.println(carWheel.getDiameter());
        System.out.println(carWheel.getWidth());
    }
}
```
