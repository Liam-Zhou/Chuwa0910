4. what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
    * JPA (Java Persistence API):
       1. JPA is a Java specification for managing relational data in Java applications. It defines a set of standard interfaces and annotations that provide a unified way to interact with relational databases.
       2. JPA is part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform and is also available as part of Java SE (Standard Edition). It allows developers to work with databases using object-oriented paradigms and abstracts away many of the low-level database interactions.
       3. JPA is not an implementation but a specification. It defines a standard API that can be implemented by various JPA providers, such as Hibernate, EclipseLink, and others.
   * Hibernate:
       1. Hibernate is an open-source, popular, and widely used implementation of the JPA specification. It provides a powerful and flexible ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java applications.
       2. Hibernate allows developers to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa. It handles database interactions, SQL generation, and caching, making it easier to work with relational databases.
       3. While Hibernate is a JPA provider, it also offers additional features and capabilities beyond the standard JPA specification, giving developers more control and flexibility.

5. What is Hikari? what is the benefits of connection pool?
    * HikariCP is a high-performance JDBC connection pool for Java applications, efficiently managing and reusing database connections.
    * Benefits of Connection Pooling:
        1. Performance: Reduces connection creation overhead, improving response times.
        2. Efficiency: Optimizes resource usage by reusing connections.
        3. Simplified Management: Handles connection lifecycle, reducing code complexity.
        4. Concurrency: Allows multiple threads to use connections concurrently.
        5. Database Load: Controls concurrent connections, preventing overload.
6. What is the  @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
   @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, and @ManyToMany are annotations used in Java Persistence API (JPA) to define relationships between entities in a relational database. These annotations are used to specify how entities are associated with each other in a database schema.
    1. @OneToMany defines a one-to-many relationship between two entities, where one entity is related to multiple instances of another entity:
    ```java
    @Entity
    public class Department {
        @Id
        private Long id;
        private String name;
        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department") // mappedBy refers to the "department" field in the Employee entity
        private List<Employee> employees;
    }
    @Entity
    public class Employee {
        @Id
        private Long id;
        private String name;
        @ManyToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "department_id") // Specifies the foreign key column in the Employee table
        private Department department;
    }
    ```
   2. @ManyToOne defines a many-to-one relationship between two entities, where multiple instances of one entity can be related to a single instance of another entity.
    ```java
    @Entity
    public class Department {
        @Id
        private Long id;
        private String name;
    }
    @Entity
    public class Employee {
        @Id
        private Long id;
        private String name;
        @ManyToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
        private Department department;
    }
    ```
   3.@ManyToMany defines a many-to-many relationship between two entities, where multiple instances of one entity can be related to multiple instances of another entity.
    ```java
    @Entity
    public class Student {
        @Id
        private Long id;
        private String name;
        @ManyToMany
        @JoinTable(
            name = "student_course",
            joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id")
        )
        private List<Course> courses;
    }
    @Entity
    public class Course {
        @Id
        private Long id;
        private String name;
        @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "courses")
        private List<Student> students;
    }
    ```
7. What is the  cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?
    * cascade = CascadeType.ALL indicates that all the operations (e.g., persist, merge, remove, refresh) performed on the parent entity should be cascaded to the associated child entity.
    * orphanRemoval = true means that removing the association or child from the parent will delete the child entity.
    <br>Common CascadeType options:
    1. CascadeType.PERSIST: Persists child when parent is persisted.
    2. CascadeType.MERGE: Merges child changes into the parent.
    3. CascadeType.REMOVE: Removes child when parent is removed (use with caution).
    4. CascadeType.REFRESH: Refreshes child with parent's state.
    5. CascadeType.DETACH: Detaches child from persistence context.

8. What is the  fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?
    * FetchType.LAZY: Data is loaded from the database only when explicitly requested. Use it for associations that aren't always needed to optimize performance.
    * FetchType.EAGER: Data is loaded immediately with the owning entity, even if it's not always used. Use it when you always need the associated data and want to reduce queries.
    * Loading data on-demand: FetchType.LAZY
    * Reducing queries by loading data eagerly: FetchType.EAGER

9. What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?
<br><br>JPA (Java Persistence API) provides a set of naming conventions and rules for mapping Java classes to database tables and their attributes to table columns. And JPA also allows you to customize the mapping if the default conventions don't fit your needs.
* Entity Class Naming:
Use CamelCase for entity class names, typically matching the table name.
* Primary Key Attribute Naming:
The primary key attribute is commonly named "id."
* Attribute to Column Mapping:
By default, JPA maps attributes to columns using the attribute name.
* Relationship Naming:
Name relationships based on their roles, e.g., "parent" and "child."
* Join Table Naming:
For many-to-many relationships, the join table name is often derived from entity names.
* Getter and Setter Naming:
Follow JavaBean naming conventions for getter and setter methods.
* Repository Method Naming:
Spring Data JPA allows you to create queries automatically by following specific method naming conventions, like "findByLastName".
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "employees")
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "full_name")
    private String fullName;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    private Department department;
}

@Entity
@Table(name = "departments")
public class Department {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "name")
    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
    private List<Employee> employees;
}

```

10. type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch 02_post_RUD,
    name the new branch with https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-redbook/
    tree/hw05_01_slides_JPQL.
<br>see coding
11. What is JPQL?
    <br>JPQL stands for Java Persistence Query Language. It is a platform-independent query language used in Java applications to interact with relational databases through Java Persistence API (JPA). JPQL is similar in syntax to SQL (Structured Query Language) but operates on Java objects and entities rather than database tables.
12. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
* @NamedQuery is used to define a single named query for an entity class.
```java
@Entity
@NamedQuery(
    name = "findAllBooks",
    query = "SELECT b FROM Book b"
)
public class Book {
}
```
* @NamedQueries is used to define multiple named queries for an entity class.
```java
@Entity
@NamedQueries({
    @NamedQuery(
        name = "findBooksByTitle",
        query = "SELECT b FROM Book b WHERE b.title = :title"
    ),
    @NamedQuery(
        name = "findBooksByAuthor",
        query = "SELECT b FROM Book b WHERE b.author.name = :authorName"
    )
})
public class Book {
}

```
14. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
    <br>@Query annotation is used to specify custom SQL or JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) queries directly in your Spring Data JPA repository interface.
    <br>We can place the @Query annotation above a method in your repository interface to provide a custom query.
15. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
    HQL (Hibernate Query Language) and Criteria Queries are two approaches for querying data using Hibernate, which is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java.
    * HQL is a query language specific to Hibernate, inspired by SQL but operating on Java objects and their relationships.
```java
String hql = "SELECT book FROM Book book WHERE book.author.name = :authorName";
Query<Book> query = session.createQuery(hql, Book.class);
query.setParameter("authorName", "John Doe");
List<Book> books = query.getResultList();
```
    * Criteria Queries are a programmatic way to create queries in Hibernate using the Criteria API.
```java
CriteriaBuilder criteriaBuilder = session.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Book> criteriaQuery = criteriaBuilder.createQuery(Book.class);
Root<Book> root = criteriaQuery.from(Book.class);

criteriaQuery.select(root)
            .where(criteriaBuilder.equal(root.get("author").get("name"), "John Doe"));

TypedQuery<Book> query = session.createQuery(criteriaQuery);
List<Book> books = query.getResultList();
```
16. What is EnityManager?
    <br>The EntityManager is a core interface in the Java Persistence API (JPA). It is part of the JPA specification and is used for managing the lifecycle of entities in a JPA-based application. The EntityManager provides methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database entities and for executing queries.

17. What is SessionFactory and Session?
    <br> SessionFactory and Session are core components of Hibernate, which is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java. Hibernate simplifies database access by providing a high-level API for interacting with relational databases.
    * SessionFactory is a factory class in Hibernate responsible for creating Session objects.
    * The Session is a lightweight and short-lived object in Hibernate, representing a single unit of work or a database session.

18. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
<br> A transaction in the context of database management refers to a series of one or more operations (such as database inserts, updates, and deletes) that are executed as a single, indivisible unit of work. Transactions ensure the consistency and integrity of the data in a database. The key properties of a transaction are often referred to as the ACID properties
<br> A transaction in a database is a series of actions treated as a single unit:
* Begin: Start a transaction before performing database operations.
* Perform Operations: Execute database actions like inserts, updates, and deletes within the transaction.
* Commit: Save changes to the database when all operations succeed.
* Handle Errors: If an error occurs, roll back the transaction to maintain data consistency.
* Close Resources: After commit or rollback, close the session or entity manager.
19. What is hibernate Caching?
<br>Hibernate caching refers to the mechanism that Hibernate uses to store and manage data in memory to improve the performance of database operations. Caching reduces the need to repeatedly fetch data from the database, which can be a costly operation, especially in applications with frequent read operations.
* First-Level Cache: Stores individual objects within a session for quick access. Enabled by default.
* Second-Level Cache: A shared cache for entities or collections, spanning multiple sessions. Improves data access across sessions.
* Query Cache: Caches the results of queries for faster retrieval, useful for read-heavy applications.

20. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
    1. Scope:
    * First-Level Cache: Associated with a single session, local.
    * Second-Level Cache: Shared among multiple sessions, global.
    2. Granularity:
    * First-Level Cache: Caches individual objects.
    * Second-Level Cache: Caches entire entities or collections.
    3. Purpose:
    * First-Level Cache: Ensures data consistency within a session.
    * Second-Level Cache: Improves performance by sharing cached data among sessions.

21. How do you understand @Transactional? (不要clone，要⾃⼰抄写并测试
    transactional，https://github.com/TAIsRich/tutorial-transaction)
    <br>see coding part
    * It's an annotation used to define transaction boundaries for methods.
    * Marks a method as transactional, ensuring database operations are atomic and consistent.
    * Spring manages transaction start, commit, and rollback automatically.
    * You can configure transaction behavior using annotation attributes.
    * Simplifies database operation handling in Spring-based applications.
22. Write a simple factory design pattern.
```java
//interface for the product
interface Product {
    void create();
}
//concrete classes that implement the product interface
class ConcreteProductA implements Product {
    @Override
    public void create() {
        System.out.println("Creating Product A");
    }
}
class ConcreteProductB implements Product {
    @Override
    public void create() {
        System.out.println("Creating Product B");
    }
}
//factory interface
interface ProductFactory {
    Product createProduct();
}
//Create concrete factory classes that implement the factory interface
class ConcreteProductFactoryA implements ProductFactory {
    @Override
    public Product createProduct() {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}
class ConcreteProductFactoryB implements ProductFactory {
    @Override
    public Product createProduct() {
        return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}
//main method
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProductFactory factoryA = new ConcreteProductFactoryA();
        Product productA = factoryA.createProduct();
        productA.create(); // Output: Creating Product A
        ProductFactory factoryB = new ConcreteProductFactoryB();
        Product productB = factoryB.createProduct();
        productB.create(); // Output: Creating Product B
    }
}

```
